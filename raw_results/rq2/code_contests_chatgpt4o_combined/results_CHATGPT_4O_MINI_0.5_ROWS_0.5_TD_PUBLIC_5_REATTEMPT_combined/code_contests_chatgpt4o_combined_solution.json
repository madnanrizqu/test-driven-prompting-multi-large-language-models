Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nRecently Johnny have learned bogosort sorting algorithm. He thought that it is too ineffective. So he decided to improve it. As you may know this algorithm shuffles the sequence randomly until it is sorted. Johnny decided that we don't need to shuffle the whole sequence every time. If after the last shuffle several first elements end up in the right places we will fix them and don't shuffle those elements furthermore. We will do the same for the last elements if they are in the right places. For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm. Johnny hopes that this optimization will significantly improve the algorithm. Help him calculate the expected amount of shuffles for the improved algorithm to sort the sequence of the first n natural numbers given that no elements are in the right places initially.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input file is number t - the number of test cases.

Here the colors are numbered from 1 to M.\nFor any cell i, Chef can repaint it with any color q, and the cost of such operation is Ci,q points.\nHowever Chef can do at most K repaintings (0 repaintings is possible). \nAfter performing all repaintings, each cell will have some color. For each cell i, if cell i has color q then Chef will receive Bi,q points.\n\nNow Chef is wondering how many points can he receive in total when he repaints optimally.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of cells and the number of colors, the maximal possible number of repaintings respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial colors of the cells. Then N lines follow. The i^th line of them contains M integers Bi1, Bi2, ..., BiM, where Bij denotes how many points Chef will receive if the cell i will be painted with j-th color after all operations. Then N lines follow. The i^th line  of them contains M integers Ci1, Ci2, ..., CiM, where Cij denotes how many points Chef will lose if he repaints the cell i with color j.\n\nNote: Be careful that the size of input files can be large.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximal possible points.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 M\n0 \u2264 Bi,j \u2264 1000\n0 \u2264 Ci,j \u2264 1000\nIf j = Ai, then Ci,j = 0\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n5\n\nExplanation:\n For this sample, we can repaint only once, since K = 1.

We will pay 1 for this, and receive: \n1 (1^st cell - 1^st color) + \n1 (2^nd cell -1^st color) + \n1 (3^rd cell - 2^nd color) + \n3 (4^th cell - 1^st color)  = 6.\nHence we get 6 \u2212 1 = 5 points in total, and it is the optimal answer.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

If the first player choose to move (5,6) to (5,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). So regardless of the move of the first player, the second will always win.\nExample case 3.

You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.\n\n\nLaddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.\n\n\nLet us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.\n\nContest Win (CodeChef\u2019s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus.\nTop Contributor on Discuss : 300\nBug Finder\t: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! \nContest Hosting\t : 50 \n\n\nYou can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.\n\n\nYou are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be \"INDIAN\" or \"NON_INDIAN\".\nFor each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. \n\t\t\tAn activity can be of four types as defined above. \n\nContest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. \nTop Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.\nBug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. \nContest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T, activities \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 rank \u2264 5000\n50 \u2264 severity \u2264 1000\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n4 NON_INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n\nOutput:\n3\n1\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, \n\nFor winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. \nFor top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. \nFor finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. \nFor hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus. \n\n\nSo, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus.\nNow, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The rules of \"Bico Grid\" are very simple.\nThe game field is a 100x100 matrix, where each cell is either a blocked cell, or a cell with some number of coins. For a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random, but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern: the i-th cell on the n-th row contains C(n, i) coins if and only if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, all other cells are blocked. Record C(n, i) denotes binomial coefficient \"n choose i\".\nThe player starts from the cell situated at row R and column C in the matrix. The objective is to collect exactly G number of coins from matrix in several moves. There are some rules: \n\nOn each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column.\nThe rules of the game state, that player mustn't be really greedy, so the number of coins he collected must not increase. In other words, if at some move the player collected X coins then further he cannot collect more than X coins in a single move.\nAfter each move, the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column W-1 (where W denotes the current column of the player). If the current column of the player has index 0, the game ends.\nThe game ends when player collects exactly G number of coins.\n\nYou are given the description of the game.

Note however that inverse road from Kiev to New-York exists. \nThe 3^rd route is incorrect since the first city coincides with the last one. \nThe 4^th route is incorrect since there is no city with name Kyiv (Probably Chef means Kiev but he misspells this word). \nThe 8^th route is incorrect since there is no road from Miami to Kiev. \nThe 9^th route is incorrect since there is no road from Donetsk to  Hollywood. \nThe 10^th route is correct. Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly. \nThe 11^th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli. (Probably Chef is not so good in geography :)) \nThe 12^th route is incorrect since city New-York is visited twice. \nFinally the 13^th route is incorrect since we have equal consecutive cities.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m). \nThen p times some element aij is increased by 1. \nThen Chef needs to calculate the following: \n\nFor each row he tries to move from the last element (with number m) to the first one (with the number 1). \nWhile staying in aij Chef can only move to aij - 1 only if aij - 1 \u2264 aij. \nThe cost of such a movement is aij - aij - 1.\nOtherwise Chef can't move and lose (in this row).\nIf Chef can move from the last element of the row to the first one, then the answer is the total cost of all the movements. \nIf Chef can't move from the last element of the row to the first one, then the answer is -1. \n\n Help Chef to find answers for all the rows after P commands of increasing. \n\nInput\n\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, m and p denoting the number of rows, the number of elements a single row and the number of increasing commands. \nEach of next p lines contains two integers i and j denoting that the element aij  is increased by one. \n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each row in a single line print the answer after the P increasing commands.\n\n\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 n, m, p \u2264 10 ^ 5\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 n\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 m\n\n\u00a0\n\nExample\nInput:\n4 4 6\n2 2\n3 2 \n3 2 \n4 3\n4 4\n4 3\n\nOutput:\n3\n3\n-1\n4\n\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation\n\nHere is the whole matrix after P commands:\n1 2 3 4\n1 3 3 4\n1 4 3 4\n1 2 5 5\n Explanations to the answer: \n\nThe first line is without changes: 4-3=1, 3-2=1, 2-1=1. answer = 3. \nThe second line: 4-3=1, 3-3=0, 3-1=2. The answer is 3. \nThe third line: 4-3=1, 3-4=-1, Chef can't move to the first number here. Therefore, the answer is -1. \nThe fourth line: 5-5=0, 5-2=3, 2-1=1.

In how many ways, can I choose K elements from the class to sit down, if I see them as being distinct?\" \nLira replied immediately with the right answer, so, the teacher decided to make the game a little funnier: \"Okay Lira, as you are so fast, now I want you to tell me exactly the same thing, but, with the addition that the value of K is changing, this is, I want you to tell me the sum of the number of ways I can sit down K of you, if the value of K goes from 1 (meaning that there are no chairs in the classroom but one) to N (meaning that all of your chairs arrived). Can you be as fast now? As the answer might get large I want you to tell me the result modulo 1000000007.

This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nFor the better understanding there is an example: \n\n\n                             1\n                        /           \\\n                  2                   4\n                /   \\                /       \\\n             3       5           7        9\n            / \\      /  \\          /  \\       /  \\\n           6  8 10 12      14 16   18 20 \nHere you can see the visualization of the process.

The Galactik Football Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy (say N). Teams like Snow Kids, Shadows, Xenons, Red Tigers, Wambas, Pirates, etc. are in total enthusiasm and are practising hard to win the cup using their talent and flux.\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\nEach planet has it's own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but because of absense of mutual agreement (duhhh.. Politics!), these goverment did not agree. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleports between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\n1. Some of the governments are greedy (duhhh..). They want to make money (You don't say!) throught the GFA. So each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\n2. Others want to sponser the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet (That's new..). The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments have always some dirty plans in their minds for the GFA.\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum ammount of money needed to fulfill their plan.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M. N is number of planets and M is number of pairs of planets which have a mutual agreement, i.e they have a spaceway between them.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nThe Little Elephant loves lucky strings. Everybody knows that the lucky string is a string of digits that contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, strings \"47\", \"744\", \"4\" are lucky while \"5\", \"17\", \"467\" are not.\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\nNotes\n\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string. In this case you should print an empty line for the corresponding test case.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 20000\n|A| = |B|\nEach character of A and B is a digit.\nSum of |A| across all the tests in the input does not exceed 200000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n4\n7\n435\n479\n7\n8\n1675475\n9756417\n\nOutput:\n7\n74\n\n777744\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"7\" and it is the lucky string.\n\n\nCase 2. If we reorder A and B as A = \"543\" and B = \"749\" the string C will be at first \"749\" and then becomes \"74\". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B.\n\n\nCase 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"8\" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits.\n\n\nCase 4. If we reorder A and B as A = \"7765541\" and B = \"5697714\" the string C will be at first \"7797744\" and then becomes \"777744\". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four \"sevens\" and two \"fours\" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string \"777744\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to.\n\n\nSo they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\n\nNote the following:\n\n At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. \n The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. \n They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1. \n\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of testcases.\nEach of the next T lines consist of the string P for that case.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case, output the number of days it takes them to cross the passage.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1  \u2264 T  \u2264 1,000,000  (10^6)\n 1  \u2264 |P|  \u2264 1,000,000 (10^6)\n The total length of P will be \u2264 5,000,000 (5 * 10^6)across all test-cases of a test-file \n P will consist of only the characters # and . \n The first and the last characters of P will be #. \n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n####\n##.#..#\n##..#.#\n##.#....#\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example, they do not need to learn any jump size. They are able to cross the entire passage by \"jumping\" lengths 1-1-1.\n\n\nFor the second example case, they get stuck at the first '.', and take one day learning to jump length 2. When they come back the next day, they get stuck at '..' and take one day to learn to jump length 3.\n\n\nFor the third example case, they get stuck first at '..', and they take one day to learn to jump length 3. On the second day, they are able to jump both length 3 as well as length 2 required to cross the passage.\n\n\nFor the last test case they need to stop and learn jumping two times. At first they need to jump a length 2 and then a length 5.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIrrelevant to the problem description, if you're curious about what Uncle Andrew was up to, he was experimenting on Magic Rings that could facilitate travel between worlds. One such world, as some of you might have heard of, was Narnia.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Chef found a directed graph with N vertices and M edges in his kitchen! \nThe evening was boring and chef has nothing else to do, so to entertain himself, Chef thought about a question \"What is the minimum number of edges he needs to reverse in order to have at least one path from vertex 1 to vertex N, where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N.\n\nInput\nEach test file contains only one test case.\nThe first line of the input contains two space separated integers N and M, denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph respectively.

Rows are numbered 1 to N, from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 to M, from left to right. You are initially at cell (1, 1) and want to go to cell (N, M). From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid. At any point you should consider all the possibilities of movement with equal probability\nLet P[i][j] be the probability of visiting cell (i, j). You need to calculate the sum of P[i][j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M.\nAs we all know, Tojo really hates probability related problems.

So the probablity of visiting (1, 1) is 1. At (1, 1) you have 2 options, move below to (2, 1) or to right cell (1, 2). Probablity of going to (1, 2) is 0.5. Probability of going to (2, 1) is 0.5. You always end up at (2, 2), so P[2][2] is 1. Required sum = 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 3.0\nExample case 2\nProbability matrix P for N=1, M=6 is\n1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0\nBecause at any position there is only one possible next position.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nYou are standing near a very strange machine. If you put C cents in the machine, the remaining money in your purse will transform in an unusual way. If you have A dollars and B cents remaining in your purse after depositing the C cents, then after the transformation you will have B dollars and A cents. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine. If at any point C > B and A > 0, then the machine will allow you to break one of the A dollars into 100 cents so you can place C cents in the machine. The machine will not allow you to exchange a dollar for 100 cents if B >= C.\n \nOf course, you want to do this to maximize your profit. For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money. You need to know how many times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximum profit. Since you are very busy man, you want to obtain the maximum possible profit in the minimum amount of time.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains three nonnegative integers A, B and C where A, B, C < 100. It means that you have A dollars and B cents in your purse and you need to put C cents in the machine to make the transformation.\n\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal number of times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximal profit. It is guaranteed that the answer is less than 10000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n9 77 69\n98 99 69\n\nOutput:\n4\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test we have the following sequence: 9.77, 8.09, 40.07, 38.39, 70.37, 68.69, 0.68. After last step we have not enough money for further transformations. The maximal profit will be after 4 transformations.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations. To be more specific, you are given a system of N linear equations of the following form:\n\nx2 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a1\nx1 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a2\n...\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN = aN - 1\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN - 1 = aN\n\nIn other words, i'th equation of the system consists of the sum of all the variable x1, ..., xN except xi to the left of the equality sign and the constant ai to the right of the equality sign.\nOne can easily prove, that a system of linear equations as described above always have exactly one solution in case N is greater than one. Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality).

At first he needs to write the module that will receive moves written by the players and analyze it. The module will receive a string and it should report at first whether this string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board (we call such strings correct) and then report whether it represents the correct move depending on the situation on the chess board. Chef always has troubles with analyzing knight moves. So at first he needs a test program that can say whether a given string is correct and then whether it represents a correct knight move (irregardless of the situation on the chess board). The cell on the chessboard is represented as a string of two characters: first character is a lowercase Latin letter from a to h and the second character is a digit from 1 to 8. The string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board if it composed of 5 characters where first two characters represent the cell where chess figure was, 3rd character is the dash \"-\" and the last two characters represent the destination cell.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 50000, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed the characters with ASCII-codes from 32 to 126. The length of the string is not greater than 10.\n\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the word \"Error\" if the corresponding string does not represent the correct pair of cells on the chess board.

So, he is going to experiment by pairing up some of his employees to see if the quality of the food prepared in his kitchen increases. However, only some pairs of employees are compatible. Two employees that are not compatible cannot be paired together.\n\n\nFor each pair of compatible employees, the Chef has assigned a number estimating how well the overall quality of the food might increase. Of course, each employee can only be paired with at most one other employee. Furthermore, it is ok to not pair some employees. So, your goal is to help the Chef decide how to pair the employees to maximize the total amount that the overall quality of food increases.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with two integers n and m. Here, n is the number of employees (between 2 and 1000) and m is the number of compatible pairs of employees (between 1 and 10,000). The employees are numbered from 0 to n-1. The next m lines describe a pair of compatible employees, one per line. The i'th such line contains two distinct integers ui,vi between 0 and n-1. Strangely enough, the Chef estimates that picking the i'th pair ui,vi will increase the quality of food prepared in his kitchen by exactly 2^i.\n\n\nNo pair of employees will be given more than once in the input. That is, for distinct indices i and j, we do not have both ui = uj and vi = vj, nor do we have both ui = vj and vi = uj.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of the indices of the pairs of employees that are used in a maximum total value pairing (the indices are between 0 and m-1). These indices should be given in increasing order with a single space between consecutive numbers. If there is more than one possible output, then any will do.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4 5\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 0\n4 3\n0 1\n2 3\n2 1\n\nOutput:\n1 4\n2\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Then follow R lines, each containing C space separated integers - the costs of different gifts.\n\n\nOutput\n Print a single integer - a value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but highest in its column.

Observe that both 8 are the minimum. Considering the first 8, look at the corresponding column (containing 8 and 6). Here, 8 is the largest element in that column. So it will be chosen.\nExample 2: There is no value in the matrix that is smallest in its row but largest in its column.\nExample 3: The required gift in matrix is not determined uniquely, but the required cost is determined uniquely.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

However, since the sheets are very old, some letters have become unreadable.\nChef would like to estimate the difference between these strings. Let's assume that the first string is named S1, and the second S2. The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The difference between the strings equals to the number of positions i, such that S1i is not equal to S2i, where S1i and S2i denote the symbol at the i the position in S1 and S2, respectively.\nChef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters. Now that you're fully aware of Chef's programming expertise, you might have guessed that he needs you help solving this problem as well. Go on, help him!\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions.\nExample case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions.\nExample case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Then, change the question marks this way: S1 = xabac, S2 = abayw, then they will differ in 5 positions.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

(I know, they have weird tastes.) Alvin and Berto always wants the split of candies to be as fair as possible. The problem is, Alvin only wants apple candies and Berto only wants banana candies!\nHere comes Chef to the rescue! Chef bought an infinite number of candy packs. There are two types of packs:\n\nPacks containing exactly C apple candies.\nPacks containing exactly D banana candies.\n\nChef wants to give some (could be zero) apple candy packs to Alvin and some (could be zero) banana candy packs to Berto in such a way that the absolute difference between the number of candies they have is minimized.

In this test case, Alvin has 1 candy and Berto has 5. The apple candies come in packs of 10, and the banana ones come in packs of 3. In this situation, Chef can make them equal by giving 1 pack of 10 to Alvin and 2 packs of 3 to Berto, so they now have 1 + 10 = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 candies each.\nExample case 2. In this test case, Alvin has 1 candy and Berto has 2. The apple and banana candies come in packs of 2. In this situation, the number of candies of Alvin is always odd, and the number of candies of Berto is always even, so Chef cannot make them equal. The minimum difference is 1, which Chef can achieve by not giving any packs at all.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Using these fundamental relations we can describe all other relations between relatives. For example, one can say that Chef Prime is son of daughter of sister of father of father of Chef Composite.\nYou are given R relations of form \"A is F of B\", for N people from the party. There variable F is one of the following strings: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister. Also you are given Q queries of Little Joe, each query has form \"X Y\". For each query output the distance between persons X and Y. Distance is equal to the minimal number of fundamental relations appearing while describing the relation between X and Y. For example distance between Chef Prime and Chef Composite is 5. \nImportant points:\n1. Here brother (or sister) relation is considered between children of same parents only. Hence cousins are not considered brother (or sister) .\n2.

Please read NOTE if you are not familiar with XOR operation. \nXOR-sum of a list of numbers is the result of XOR-ing all of them. XOR-sum of (A[1] XOR A[2] XOR ... XOR A[N]) is defined as A[1] XOR (A[2] XOR (A[3] XOR ( ... XOR A[N]))).\nHe has an array A consisting of N integers. Index in the array are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. Let us denote by F(L, R), the XOR-sum of all integers in the array A whose indices lie from L to R, inclusive, i.e. F(L, R) = A[L] XOR A[L+1] XOR ... XOR A[R]. Your task is to find the total sum of XOR-sums F(L, R) over all L and R such that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of A. The second line contains N space-separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the total sum to the corresponding test case.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100,000\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 1,000,000,000 (10^9)\nThe total sum of all N over all test cases will not exceed 100,000.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. F(1, 1) = A[1] = 1, F(2, 2) = A[2] = 2 and F(1, 2) = A[1] XOR A[2] = 1 XOR 2 = 3. Hence the answer is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\n\nNOTE\n\nXOR operation is a bitwise \"Exclusive OR\" operation performed on two integers in binary representation. First, the shorter number is prepended with leading zeroes until the numbers have equal size in binary. Then the resulting number (also in binary) contains 0 in all positions where the corresponding bits coincide, and 1 on the rest of the positions.\n For example, 3 XOR 5 = 0112 XOR 1012 = 1102 = 6.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Magician Cyael is one such magician.\nCyael has been having some issues with her last performances and today she\u2019ll have to perform for an audience of some judges, who will change her tournament ranking, possibly increasing it. As she is a great magician she managed to gather a description of the fixed judges\u2019 disposition on the room (which is represented as an N \u00d7 N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the fixed points each judge will provide. She also knows that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j]. Note that some judges can award Cyael, zero points or negative points, as they are never pleased with her performance.\nThere is just one judge at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N].\nTo complete her evaluation, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 \u2264 N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 \u2264 N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor. Cyael will be judged at all visited cells with a judge.\n\nCyael wants to maximize her average score at end of her performance. More specifically, if she passes K judges, each being on cell [i1][j1], cell [i2][j2], ..., cell [iK][jK] respectively, then she wants to maximize (S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]) / K, where S[i][j] denotes the points that the judge will give her on the cell [i][j].\nHelp her determine the best path she has to follow in order to maximize her average points.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description for T test cases follows. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer N. Each of the next N lines contains N space-separated integers.\nThe j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the points awarded by the judge at cell [i][j].\nNote that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no judges, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, if the maximum possible average points Cyael can obtain is negative, output a single line containing \"Bad Judges\" (quotes for clarity).

A lot of boys were dreaming of becoming a knight, while a lot of girls were dreaming of marrying a knight on a white horse.\n\nIn this problem we consider one of these tournaments.\n\n\nLet's us call a tournament binary, if it runs according to the scheme described below:\n\n\nExactly N knights take part in the tournament, N^K for some integer K > 0.\nEach knight has a unique skill called strength, described as an integer from the interval [1, N].\nInitially, all the knights are standing in a line, waiting for a battle. Since all their strengths are unique, each initial configuration can be described as a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.\nThere are exactly K rounds in the tournament, 2^K - i + 1 knights take part in the i'th round. The K'th round is called the final.\nThe i'th round runs in the following way: for each positive integer j \u2264 2^K - i happens a battle between a knight on the 2\u2219j'th position and a knight on the 2\u2219j+1'th position. The strongest of two continues his tournament, taking the j'th position on the next round, while the weakest of two is forced to leave.\nThe only knight, who has won K rounds, is the winner. The only knight, who has won K - 1 rounds, but lost the final, is the runner-up.\n\t\n\nAs you can see from the scheme, the winner is always the same, an initial configuration doesn't change anything. So, your task is to determine chances of each knight to appear in the final.\n\n\nFormally, for each knight you need to count the number of initial configurations, which will lead him to the final. Since the number can be extremly huge, you are asked to do all the calculations under modulo 10^9 + 9.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains the only integer K, denoting the number of rounds of the tournament.\n\u00a0\n\nOutput\nOutput should consist of 2^K lines.

So everyday, each villager will take exactly one laddu to one of the dinosaurs in such a way that no dinosaur remains hungry (note that this is possible because number of villagers is the same as the number of dinosaurs).\n\n\nActually, carrying laddus is a quite a tough job. Villagers have to use a bullock cart for that. It takes one unit of grass a bullock to\ncarry a cart with 1 laddu for 1 kilometre. Laddus used to be very heavy in DevuLand, so a bullock cart can not carry more than one laddu.\nIt is also given distance between village indexed i and j is |j - i| (the absolute value) kilometres.\n\n\nNow villagers sat down and found a strategy to feed laddus to dinosaurs so that they need to buy the least amount of grass from the nearby market.\nThey are not very good in\ncalculations, please find out what is the minimum number of units of grass they need to buy.\n\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.\n\n\nFor each test case, there are two lines.\n\n\nFirst line contains a single integer denoting n: number of villages.\n\n\nSecond line contains n space separated integers denoting the array D.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the integer corresponding to answer of the problem.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5 \n 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5 \n -10^4 \u2264 D[i] \u2264 10^4 \n Sum of n over all the test cases will be \u2264 10^6 \n It is guaranteed that sum of D[i] is zero for a single test case which ensures that there are equal number of villagers and dinosaurs. \n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2\n5 -5\n2\n-5 5\n3\n1 2 -3\nOutput:\n5\n5\n4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

Each villager in village 2, need to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur 1st village.\nExample case 3.

The Chef is a Game Master, so his concern is how to manage the game but not how to win the game like his assistants do.\n\n\nThe game requires players to find the only ball under one of the N cups after their positions are changed in a special way. At the beginning of the game, The Chef places N cups in a row and put a ball under the C-th cup from the left (the cups are numbered from 1 to N). All players can see the initial position of the ball. Then Chef performs Q flip operations. Each flip operation is defined by two integers L and R such that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and consists in reversing the segment [L, R] of cups. Namely, Chef swaps L-th and R-th cups, (L+1)-th and (R\u22121)-th cups, and so on. After performing all the operations Chef asks his assistants to choose a cup that they think the ball is under it. Who can guess the position of the ball will win the game, and of course, the others will have to clean the kitchen.\n\n\nThe Chef doesn't want to check all the N cups at the end of the game. He notes down the value of C and the pairs (L, R) and asked you, the mastered programmer, to determine the cup that contains the ball.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

Please, note that more than one chef can represent a country.\nEach of them presents their best dish to the audience. The audience then sends emails to a secret and secure mail server, with the subject being the name of the chef whom they wish to elect as the \"Chef of the Year\".\nYou will be given the list of the subjects of all the emails. Find the country whose chefs got the most number of votes, and also the chef who got elected as the \"Chef of the Year\" (the chef who got the most number of votes).\nNote 1\nIf several countries got the maximal number of votes, consider the country with the lexicographically smaller name among them to be a winner. Similarly if several chefs got the maximal number of votes, consider the chef with the lexicographically smaller name among them to be a winner.\nNote 2\nThe string A = a1a2...an is called lexicographically smaller then the string B = b1b2...bm in the following two cases:\n\nthere exists index i \u2264 min{n, m} such that aj = bj for 1 \u2264 j < i and ai < bi;\nA is a proper prefix of B, that is, n < m and aj = bj for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n.\n\nThe characters in strings are compared by their ASCII codes.\nRefer to function strcmp in C or to standard comparator < for string data structure in C++ for details.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of chefs and the number of emails respectively. Each of the following N lines contains two space-separated strings, denoting the name of the chef and his country respectively. Each of the following M lines contains one string denoting the subject of the email.\n\nOutput\nOutput should consist of two lines.

Here we have only one chef Leibniz and he is from Germany. Clearly, all votes are for him. So Germany is the country-winner and Leibniz is the \"Chef of the Year\".\nExample 2. Here we have chefs Torricelli and Lagrange from Italy, chef Ramanujan from India and chef Gauss from Germany. Torricelli got 2 votes, while Lagrange got one vote. Hence the Italy got 3 votes in all. Ramanujan got also 2 votes. And so India got 2 votes in all. Finally Gauss got no votes leaving Germany without votes. So the country-winner is Italy without any ties. But we have two chefs with 2 votes: Torricelli and Ramanujan. But since the string \"Ramanujan\" is lexicographically smaller than \"Torricelli\", then Ramanujan is the \"Chef of the Year\".\nExample 3. Here we have two countries with 1 vote: England and Greece. Since the string \"England\" is lexicographically smaller than \"Greece\", then England is the country-winner. Next, we have two chefs with 1 vote: Newton and Euclid. Since the string \"Euclid\" is lexicographically smaller than \"Newton\", then Euclid is the \"Chef of the Year\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Then she gives you a bundle of cards each having a sorted list (in ascending order) of some distinct integers written on it. The integers in all the lists are between 1 and N. Note that the same integer may appear in more than one card. Now, she shows you these cards one by one and asks whether the number you thought is written on the card or not. After that, she immediately tells you the integer you had thought of.\nSeeing you thoroughly puzzled, she explains that she can apply the trick so fast because she is just adding the first integer written on the cards that contain the integer you had thought of, and then gives the sum as the answer. She calls a bundle interesting if when the bundle is lexicographically sorted, no two consecutive cards have any number in common. Now she challenges you to find out the minimum number of cards she will need for making an interesting bundle such that the magic trick will work every time.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains a line with a single integer N.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing a single integer denoting the minimum number of cards required.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^18\n\n\nSub tasks\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1\n4\n\nOutput:\n1\n3\n\nExplanation\n\nIn example 1, only 1 card containing {1} will work.\nIn example 2, make 3 cards containing {1,4}, {2} and {3,4}.\n\nAssume you thought of 1, then you will select the 1^st card {1,4}, then she will correctly figure out the integer you thought being 1.\nAssume you thought of 2, then you will select the 2^nd card {2}, then she will correctly figure out the integer you thought being 2.\nAssume you thought of 3, then you will select the 3^rd card {3,4}, then she will correctly figure out the integer you thought being 3.\nAssume you thought of 4, then you will select 1^st card {1,4} and 3^rd card {3,4}, then she will calculate the sum of the first integers of the two card 1 + 3 = 4, and she will answer it.\n\nThus her trick will work well in every case.

Po offers dragon food to master Shifu, who is a famous cook in the valley of food. In return, Shifu hands over the dragon scroll to Po, which is said to hold the ingredients of the secret recipe. To open the dragon scroll, one has to solve the following puzzle. \n1. Consider a N-bit integer A. We call an integer A' as shuffle-A, if A' can be obtained by shuffling the bits of A in its binary representation. For eg. if N = 5 and A = 6 = (00110)2,  A' can be any 5-bit integer having exactly two 1s in it i.e., any of (00011)2, (00101)2, (00110)2, (01010)2, ...., (11000)2.\n2. Given two N-bit integers A and B, find the maximum possible value of (A' xor B') where A' is a shuffle-A, B' is a shuffle-B and xor is the bit-wise xor operator.\nGiven N, A and B, please help Po in opening the dragon scroll.\nNotes\n1. xor operator takes two bit strings of equal length and performs the logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 OR only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 1 or both are 0. For eg: 5 (0101) xor 3(0011) = 6(0110). In most languages it is represented using ^ symbol. 5 ^ 3 = 6.\n2. If the integer actually needs less than N bits to represent in binary, append sufficient number of leading 0 bits. For eg. as shown in the problem statement for N = 5, A = 6 = (00110)2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 100 ). T cases follow, each having N A B in a single line, separated by a space. ( 1 <= N <= 30, 0 <= A,B < 2^N )\n\n\nOutput\nFor each case, output the maximum possible value of (shuffle-A xor shuffle-B) in a separate line.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n3 5 4\n5 0 1\n4 3 7\n\n\nOutput:\n7\n16\n14\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nCase 1: 5 and 4 as 3-bit binary strings are (101)2 and (100)2 respectively. After shuffling, xor can be maximum for (110)2 ^ (001)2 = (111)2 = 7\nCase 2: Maximum Possible result can be for (00000)2 ^ (10000)2 = (10000)2 = 16\nCase 3: Maximum Possible result can be for (0011)2 ^ (1101)2 = (1110)2 = 14\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

They both have decided to make moves turn by turn. In one turn, the player picks some number from the list and discards that number. The one who is not able to make a valid move will be the loser. To make the game more interesting, they decided to put some constraints on their moves.\nA constraint on a game can be any of following three types :\n\n > K : They are allowed to choose numbers having values strictly greater than K only.\n < K : They are allowed to choose numbers having values strictly less than K only.\n = K : They are allowed to choose numbers having values equal to K only.\n\n \nGiven M constraints and who goes first, you have to tell the outcome of each game.

T test cases follow. Each test case stats with a line containing two space separated strings A and B, denoting the names of the parents. The next line contains a single integer N denoting the number of children A and B are planning to have. Following this are N lines, the i'th line containing Ci, the proposed name for the i'th child.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single line containing \"YES\" if the names are permissible by Archer's plan, otherwise print \"NO\".

Consider Z = \"iamlordvoldemort\". It is not difficult to see that Z is a permutation of X and Y is a substring of Z. Hence Y is a substring of a permutation of X, so the answer is \"YES\".\n\nCase 2: Here X = \"cheapup\", and Y = \"heapcup\". Since Y in itself is a permutation of X, and as every string is a substring of itself, Y is a substring of X and also a permutation of X. Hence \"YES\".\n\nCase 3: Here X = \"brucewayne\", and Y = \"batman\".

The boy likes to compose his disks in stacks, but there's one very important rule: the disks in a single stack must be ordered by their radiuses in a strictly increasing order such that the top-most disk will have the smallest radius.\n\n\nFor example, a stack of disks with radii (5, 2, 1) is valid, while a stack of disks with radii (3, 4, 1) is not.\n\n\nLittle Mike has recently come up with the following algorithm after the order of disks are given:\n\n\nFirst, Mike initiates an empty set of disk stacks.\nThen, Mike processes the disks in the chosen order using the following pattern:\n\nIf there is at least one stack such that Mike can put the current disk on the top of the stack without making it invalid, then he chooses the stack with the smallest top disk radius strictly greater than the radius of the current disk, and puts the current disk on top of that stack.\nOtherwise, Mike makes a new stack containing only the current disk.\n\t\n\n\nFor example, let's assume that the order of the disk radii is (3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2). Here's how the set of the top stack disks will appear during the algorithm's run:\n\n\nIn the beginning of the algorithm, the set of disk stacks is empty. After processing the first disk, the set of top stack disks is {3}.\nWe cannot put the second disk on the only stack that we have after processing the first disk, so we make a new stack. After processing the second disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4}.\nWe cannot put the third disk on any of the available stacks, so we make a new stack. After processing the third disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4, 5}.\nThe fourth disk has radius 1, so it can be easily put on any of the available stacks. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 3. After processing the fourth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 4, 5}.\nThe fifth disk has radius 1, so there are two stacks we can put it on. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 4. After processing the fifth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 5}.\nThe sixth disk has radius 2, so there is only one stack we can put it on. The final set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 2}.\n\n\nMike is really excited about his new algorithm, but he has so many disks that it seems impossible to simulate the algorithm manually.\n\n\nYou are given an array A of N integers denoting the radii of Mike's disks. The disks are already ordered by Mike. Your task is to find the set of the stack top disk radii after the algorithm is done.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The line should start with a positive integer S denoting the number of stacks after the algorithm is done.

From now on, he decided to paint 1D pictures only.\nChef's canvas is N millimeters long and is initially all white. For simplicity, colors will be represented by an integer between 0 and 10^5. 0 indicates white. The picture he is envisioning is also N millimeters long and the i^th millimeter consists purely of the color Ci. Unfortunately, his brush isn't fine enough to paint every millimeter one by one. The brush is 3 millimeters wide and so it can only paint three millimeters at a time with the same color. Painting over the same place completely replaces the color by the new one. Also, Chef has lots of bottles of paints of each color, so he will never run out of paint of any color.\nChef also doesn't want to ruin the edges of the canvas, so he doesn't want to paint any part beyond the painting. This means, for example, Chef cannot paint just the first millimeter of the canvas, or just the last two millimeters, etc.\nHelp Chef by telling him whether he can finish the painting or not with these restrictions.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the colors of Chef's painting.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can finish the painting or not.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n3 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\nThe sum of the Ns over all the test cases in a single test file is \u2264 5\u00d710^5\n1 \u2264 Ci \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\r\n3\r\n4\r\n1 5 5 5\r\n4\r\n1 1 1 5\r\n3\r\n5 5 2\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the first three millimeters with color 1, so the colors become [1,1,1,0], and then the last three millimeters with color 5 so that it becomes [1,5,5,5].\nExample case 2. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the last three millimeters by color 5 so the colors become [0,5,5,5], and then the first three millimeters by color 1 so it becomes [1,1,1,5].\nExample case 3. In this test case, Chef can only paint the painting as a whole, so all parts must have the same color, and the task is impossible.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Both of the dogs are too intelligent to know the smell of each type of apple. If Chef gives a dog an integer x, and releases it at one end of the row of apples, then the dog smells each apple one by one. Once the dog find an apple of type x, the dog picks the apple and back to Chef's room immidiately. If there is no apple of type x, then the dog will back without any apples.\nNow Chef wants to eat two apples as soon as possible. Here the apples must have distinct types, and the sum of the types must be equal to K. Chef can release the dogs from either of the ends, namely, he can leave (both at left end) or (both at right end) or (one at left end and one at right end) and he can release them at the same time.

Thus Chef needs to wait 2 seconds.

You are given the coefficients in F(N) and the target sum S. Please, find the number of different multisets modulo 1,000,000,007.\nYou should consider a multiset as an unordered sequence of integers. Two multisets are different if and only if there at least exists one element which occurs X times in the first multiset but Y times in the second one, where (X \u2260 Y).\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains four integers A0, A1, A2, A3.

So, you have one distinct object of rang 1, two distinct objects of rang 2, three distinct objects of rang 3 and so on.

These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.\n\nThe technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called \"Traveling Salesman Problem\" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product\n\n1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N.\nThe programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function.\nFor example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then  Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never \"lose\" any\ntrailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.\n\nInput\nThere is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.\n\nOutput\nFor every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).\n\nExample\nSample Input:\n\n6\n3\n60\n100\n1024\n23456\n8735373\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n14\n24\n253\n5861\n2183837\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nWho's interested in football?\nRayne Wooney has been one of the top players for his football club for the last few years. But unfortunately, he got injured during a game a few months back and has been out of play ever since.\nHe's got proper treatment and is eager to go out and play for his team again. Before doing that, he has to prove to his fitness to the coach and manager of the team. Rayne has been playing practice matches for the past few days. He's played N practice matches in all.\nHe wants to convince the coach and the manager that he's improved over time and that his injury no longer affects his game. To increase his chances of getting back into the team, he's decided to show them stats of any 2 of his practice games. The coach and manager will look into the goals scored in both the games and see how much he's improved. If the number of goals scored in the 2nd game(the game which took place later) is greater than that in 1st, then he has a chance of getting in. Tell Rayne what is the maximum improvement in terms of goal difference that he can show to maximize his chances of getting into the team. If he hasn't improved over time, he's not fit to play. Scoring equal number of goals in 2 matches will not be considered an improvement. Also, he will be declared unfit if he doesn't have enough matches to show an improvement.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with a single integer N, the number of practice matches Rayne has played.\nThe next line contains N integers. The ith integer, gi, on this line represents the number of goals Rayne scored in his ith practice match. The matches are given in chronological order i.e. j > i means match number j took place after match number i.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case output a single line containing the maximum goal difference that Rayne can show to his coach and manager. If he's not fit yet, print \"UNFIT\".\n\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=10\n1<=N<=100000\n0<=gi<=1000000 (Well, Rayne's a legend! You can expect him to score so many goals!)\n\n\nExample:\nInput:\n3\n6\n3 7 1 4 2 4\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n5\n4 3 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4\nUNFIT\n1\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first test case, Rayne can choose the first and second game. Thus he gets a difference of 7-3=4 goals. Any other pair would give him a lower improvement.\nIn the second test case, Rayne has not been improving in any match. Thus he's declared UNFIT.\nNote: Large input data. Use faster I/O methods. Prefer scanf,printf over cin/cout.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

This time he has a permutation A[1], A[2], ..., A[N] of numbers 1, 2, ..., N.\n\n\nHe calls a permutation A good, if the number of its inversions is equal to the number of its local inversions. The number of inversions is equal to the number of pairs of integers (i; j) such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N and A[i] > A[j], and the number of local inversions is the number of integers i such that 1 \u2264 i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has several such permutations. Help him to find for each permutation whether it is good or not. Print YES for a corresponding test case if it is good and NO otherwise.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of a permutation. The next line contains N space separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.

Here N = 1, so we have no pairs (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N. So the number of inversions is equal to zero. The number of local inversion is also equal to zero. Hence this permutation is good.\n\n\nCase 2. Here N = 2, and we have one pair (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, the pair (1; 2). Since A[1] = 2 and A[2] = 1 then A[1] > A[2] and the number of inversions is equal to 1. The number of local inversion is also equal to 1 since we have one value of i for which 1 \u2264 i < N (the value i = 1) and A[i] > A[i+1] for this value of i since A[1] > A[2]. Hence this permutation is also good.\n\n\nCase 3. Here N = 3, and we have three pairs (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N. We have A[1] = 3, A[2] = 2, A[3] = 1. Hence A[1] > A[2], A[1] > A[3] and A[2] > A[3]. So the number of inversions is equal to 3. To count the number of local inversion we should examine inequalities A[1] > A[2] and A[2] > A[3]. They both are satisfied in our case, so we have 2 local inversions. Since 2 \u2260 3 this permutations is not good.\n\n\nCase 4. Here we have only one inversion and it comes from the pair (2; 3) since A[2] = 3 > 2 = A[3]. This pair gives also the only local inversion in this permutation. Hence the number of inversions equals to the number of local inversions and equals to one. So this permutation is good.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

So, it adds 0 to total score.\nIn second step, he can color upper right cell, it also adds total 0 to the score.\nIn third step, he can color top left cell. There are two neighboring cell of this cell, both of which are colored. So, this add 2 to the score.\nIn the last step, he can choose the remaining down right cell.

The safest way from Chef's town to Byteland is through the path of tasty dishes. The path is named so because there are magical tasty dishes which appear to the traveler that no one can resist eating. Also, Suraj has added a strong sleep potion to each of the dish on this path to stop anyone from following him.\nKnowing the devilish nature of Suraj, Ashi is concerned about the Chef and has asked all of Chef's town people to help. The distance from Chef's town to Byteland through the the path of tasty dishes is X units. They have the location where the magic dishes are and how many people are required to eat it completely. Anyone who eats a dish would go to a long sleep and won't be able to continue. They have the information about the tribal clans that live along the the path of tasty dishes who can be of real help in this journey. \nThe journey Chef and his friends can be described as follows: There is a total of B dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Each dish is located at some distance from Chef's town denoted by xi for the i^th dish ( xi-1 <  xi). To minimize the number of friends Chef has to leave behind, all of them have decided that exactly yi of them will eat the i^th dish, which is the required number of people needed to finish it completely. Also, there are a total of C tribal chef clans, each with their own population and location on the path that Chef and his friends will meet on their way to Byteland. They know that for some clan (say i), they are located at a distance of pi ( pi-1 <  pi) from Chef's town with a population of ri. And if a group of at least qi men approaches them, they would be able to convince them to join their forces against Suraj.\nGiven the information about all this, help the Chef to find out the minimum size of the group (including him and his friends) he should start with to reach Byteland and get back Ashi's gift from Suraj.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines which are as follows:\nFirst line of each test case contains X, the distance of Byteland from Chef's town.\nNext line contains an integer B, the number of dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Then follows B pairs of space separated integers of the form xi yi, where xi yi are as defined above for the i^th dish.\nNext line contains an integer C, followed C space separated triplets of integers pi qi ri as defined above.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the minimum size of the group  (including Chef) that is needed to reach Byteland.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 X \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 B \u2264 10000\n Constraints on C\n\nSubproblem 1 (25 points):  C = 0\nSubproblem 2 (75 points): 1 \u2264 C \u2264 10000\n\n\n1 \u2264 xi < X, xi < xi+1\n1 \u2264 pi < X, pi < pi+1\n1 \u2264 yi \u2264 10^14\n1 \u2264 qi \u2264 10^14\n1 \u2264 ri \u2264 10^14\nAll the positions, of the tasty dishes and tribal clans are distinct.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n10\n2 1 3 8 1\n0\n10\n2 1 3 8 5\n0\n10\n2 2 3 8 5\n3 1 2 1 4 3 2 9 1 1 \n\nOutput:\n5\n9\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the first case, there are no tribal clans, and two dishes, one which needs to be eaten by 3 chefs on their way and one to be eaten by 1 chef. Hence, we have to start with atleast 5 people in total to pass the path of tasty dishes.\nExample case 2. Similar as Example Case 1.\nExample case 3. In this case, if we start with 5 Chefs. At point 1, we have more than or equal to 2 chefs, hence the tribal clan of size 1 adds to the Chef's party and now they have size of 6. At position 2, three of them would be left behind eating a dish, leaving 3 of them to go ahead. At position 4, since the size is exactly 3, the tribal clan joins the chef's party making it of size 5. At position 8, all 5 of them will stop to eat the dish and none would go ahead. Similarly, if we start with 6, one of them would be able to pass position 8 and reach position 9, where it will also add one of the tribal clans to its party and reach Byteland.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He even looted his own people, by using the following unfair strategy:\nThere are N houses in Maahishmati, and the i^th house has Ai gold plates. Each gold plate costs exactly 1 Nimbda, which is the unit of currency in the kingdom of Maahishmati. Bhallaladeva would choose an integer K, and loots all the houses in several steps. In each step:\n\nHe would choose a house i which hasn't been looted yet, pay the owner exactly Ai Nimbdas, and take away all the gold plates in that house (Hence, he also ends up looting this house).\nHe would now choose atmost K houses which haven't been looted yet and take away all the gold plates from these houses without paying a single Nimbda (Yes, he takes all of them for free).\n\n\nHe repeats the above steps until all the N houses have been looted. Your task is to devise a strategy for Bhallaladeva to loot the houses in some order, so that the number of nimbdas he has to pay is minimium. You'll also be given multiple values of K (Q of them to be precise), and you need to find the minimum number of nimbdas for each of these values.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of houses in Maahishmati.

Hence, Bhallaladeva cannot take gold plates from any of the houses for free. It will cost him 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 10 nimbdas.\nFor the second query, K = 2. In the first step Bhallaladeva can pay 2 nimbdas for gold plates in house number 2, and take the gold in houses 1 and 4 for free (Note that house 1 has 3 gold plates and house 4 has 4 gold plates). Now, he has looted houses 1, 2 & 4. Now in the second step, he loots house 3, by paying 1 nimbda. Hence, the total cost = 1 + 2 = 3.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nRecently Chef has decided to make some changes in our beloved Codechef. As you know, each problem at Codechef has its memory and time limits. To make problems even more challenging, he decided to measure allocated memory in a different way. Now judge program will be calculating not the maximum memory usage during the execution of all test files, but all the memory ever allocated by the solution program. But as Chef is not that good in algorithms, so he asks you to write a program that will calculate total memory usage of a solution.\nSo, you are given N numbers M1, , ,MN representing the measurements of consumed memory (in MBs) for N test files. In other terms, it means that on i-th test file, program took Mi MBs of memory. Initially, there is no memory allocated for your program. Before running your program on each test file, if the currently allocated memory is more than memory needed for the current test file, then there will be a deallocation of the memory to fit the current program. Also, if there is less than needed memory available, then allocation of memory will happen so as to fit the current program. e.g. Let us say that our program took 10 MBs on current test file. So, assuming if there was 12 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a deallocation of 2 MBs. Assuming if there was 8 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a allocation of 2 MBs.\n\n\nCalculate the total memory allocated for running the solution program on all the N test files. Please see third sample for more clarity.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the  number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of measurements. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers, where i^th integer denotes the consumption of memory for i^th i-th test file.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print total memory allocated for running the solution program.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Mi \u2264 10^9\n sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2\n1 1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3\n1 3 2\n\nOutput:\n1\n5\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Initially, there was no memory allocated. For running first test file, there was a memory allocation of 1 MBs. There was no allocation/ deallocation for running your program on second test file. \nExample case 2. On running on each test file, there was a further allocation of 1 MBs from previous one. So, there are total 5 MBs of memory allocated while running the program.\nExample case 3. Initially, there was no memory allocated. For running first test file, there was a memory allocation of 1 MBs. For running second test file, there was a further memory allocation of 2 MBs to have 3 MBs of memory needed, then in the last file, there was a deallocation of 1 MB of memory so as to get 2 MBs of memory needed for running the program. So, overall, there was 1 + 2 = 3 MBs of memory ever allocated in the program. Note that we are only counting allocated memory, not allocated + unallocated.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

There is a room in every vertex of the hypercube. The room can be denoted with N it's coordinates. For any two rooms, there is a corridor between them if the square of the euclidean distance is no more than D units. \nSometimes, Jane wants to make a clean-up in her house. In order to do that, she needs to visit all the rooms. She starts with a room with the coordinates (S1, S2, ... SN) and then wants to move through all the rooms via corridors in such a way that she will visit all the rooms, and, at the same time, won't visit any room twice (she does not want to step on a floor which is not dried yet).\nPlease find such a route for Jane or state that it's impossible to find one.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and D denoting the number of dimensions of the space Jane lives in and the square of the maximal euclidean distance between two rooms, connected via corridor.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers S1, S2, ..., SN denoting the coordinates of the room where Jane starts the cleaning.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output:\n\nif the a route exists output 2^N lines, each containing N space separated integers, denoting the coordinates of the corresponding room in the route. For every test case, the coordinates of the first room in the route should coincide with the given location. If there is more than one solution, you can print any one of them.\nif such a route doesn't exist, output just -2 on the separate line.\n\n\nConstraints\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 5\n-1 -1\n4 3\n1 -1 1 -1\n\nOutput:\n-1 -1\n1 -1\n1 1\n-1 1\n-2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

Mr.Ping makes the best noodle soup and his son Po is eagerly waiting for the user reviews in his father's blog. Users can vote with a (+) or a (-) and accordingly +1 or -1 is added to the total score respectively. Note that if a user votes multiple times, only his/her latest vote is counted towards the total score.\nPo opens the blog to see initial score of 0. To see the updated score without refreshing the page, he has to keep voting himself. After each of Po's clicks on (+) or (-), he can see the current total score, of course that considers Po's vote too. He is wondering how many users other than him could have possibly voted. Given the sequence of clicks made by Po and the total score displayed just after each of his clicks, can you tell him the minimum number of users that could have possibly voted at least once, other than Po.\n\n\nInput\nThere are multiple test cases ( at most 21 ). Each case starts with an integer N ( 1 <= N <= 1000 ), the number of Po's clicks. Sequence of N clicks follows, one on each line of the form \"vote score\" (without quotes, separated by a space), where vote is either a 'P' or a 'M', representing Plus(+) and Minus(-) respectively, the one clicked by Po and score is the score displayed after Po's click ( -1,000,000,000 <= score <= 1,000,000,000 ). The last case has N = 0 and should not be processed. Each case is followed by an empty line.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of users that could have possibly voted at least once.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\nP 1\nP 2\n\n2\nP 2\nM -2\n\n0\n\nOutput:\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation:\nCase 1 :\nP 1 , Po voted (+) and score = 1 is possibly Po's vote itself.\nP 2 , Po again voted (+), but as only latest vote of a user is counted, Po contributed only +1 to the score, so possibly one more user voted with a (+). Remember that we have to find the number of users other than Po, so answer is 1\n\nCase 2 :\nP 2 , Po voted (+) and score = 2, possibly another user A also voted (+)\nM -2 , Po voted (-) and score = -2. Possibly the same user A also voted (-)\nSo there can possibly be just one other user A\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, he was surprised that ordinary fractions are sometimes used to represent this number approximately. For example, 22/7, 355/113 or even 103993/33102.\nSoon, by calculating the value of 22/7 and 355/113 on paper Chef became quite disappointed because these values are not precise enough. For example, 22/7 differs in the third digit after the decimal point. So, these values are definitely should not be used for serious calculations.\nHowever, Chef doesn't know anything about 103993/33102. This fraction is quite inconvenient to calculate on paper. Chef is curious how precise this value is. So he asks you to help him and to calculate the first K digits after the decimal point of such an approximation of \u03c0. He consider this ordinary fraction as infinite decimal fraction so formally he asks you to calculate this approximation truncated to the first K digits after the decimal point.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nIn Wolf town there are 2 big markets S and T. The distance between these markets is D. Chef Ciel would like to run 2 restaurants in Wolf town, where the first restaurant will be supplied by the market S and the second one will be supplied by the market T. The markets run delivery service without charge within some distance, DS and DT respectively. Near these markets there are many rival restaurants. So Ciel decides to build one of her restaurants exactly at the distance DS from the market S, and build the other restaurant exactly at the distance DT from the market T.\nChef Ciel would like to build her restaurants as close as possible to each other for convenient communication. Your task is to calculate the minimum distance that could be achieved between her restaurants.\nNote. Wolf town can be considered as an infinite 2D Cartesian plane. The markets and Ciel's restaurants should be considered as points on a plane. The distance between the two points A and B, whose coordinates are (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By) respectively, is defined by Dist(A, B) = ((Ax \u2212 Bx)^2 + (Ay \u2212 By)^2)^1/2.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers DS, DT and D.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum possible distance between Ciel's restaurants that could be achieved. The output must have an absolute or relative error at most 0.000001 (10^\u22126). Please, note that your output should not have more than 1000 digits after the decimal point, otherwise you may (or may not) get wrong answer or runtime error (SIGXFSZ).\nNote also that the answer could be 0, which means that two Ciel's restaurants should be located at the same building.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 2013\n1 \u2264 DS, DT, D \u2264 2013\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n15 15 50\n15 15 18\n43 88 200\n2013 2013 2013\n\nOutput:\n20.000\n0.0\n69.00000\n0\n\nExplanation \nExample case 1. The distance between markets S and T is 50. Assume for simplicity that S has coordinates (0, 0) and T has coordinates (50, 0). Then Ciel could build her first restaurant RS at the point (15, 0) and the second restaurant RT at the point (35, 0). This will ensure that the distance between S and RS is DS = 15 and the distance between T and RT is DT = 15. The distance between restaurants appear to be 20 in this scenario. One can prove that this is the minimum possible distance.\nExample case 2. Here Ciel can locate both her restaurants at the same place. Indeed, if S = (0, 0) and T = (18, 0) then Ciel could locate both her restaurants at the point R = (9, 12). To check this note that Dist(R, S) = ((9 \u2212 0)^2 + (12 \u2212 0)^2)^1/2 = (81 + 144)^1/2 = 225^1/2 = 15. Similarly it can be verified that Dist(R, T) = 15.\nExample case 3. It is similar to the example case 1. If S = (0, 0) and T = (200, 0) then the best way is to locate Ciel's restaurants at the points RS = (43, 0) and RT = (112, 0). You can easily check by yourself that Dist(S, RS) = 43, Dist(T, RT) = 88 and Dist(RS, RT) = 69.\nJust to reiterate, your output can have any number of digits after the decimal point unless it is too long (more than 1000 digits after decimal point). However your output must have an absolute or relative error at most 10^\u22126.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

But as there was a lot of people coming and wishing him. It was interfering with his game which made him very angry and he banged the table very hard due to which K numbers from the permutation fell down and went missing.\nSeeing her son's gift being spoilt, his mom became very sad. Chef didn't want his mom to be sad as he loves her the most. So to make her happy, he decided to play a game with her with the remaining N - K numbers on the table. Chef wants his mom to win all the games.\nChef and his mom play alternatively and optimally. In Xth move, a player can choose some numbers out of all the numbers available on the table such that chosen numbers sum up to X. After the move, Chosen numbers are placed back on the table.The player who is not able to make a move loses.\nNow, Chef has to decide who should move first so that his Mom wins the game.\nAs Chef is a small child, he needs your help to decide who should move first.

The schedule for the trains has recently been changed and he wants to know how long it will take to travel from the station nearest to his house and the station nearest to his restaurant.\n\n\nThe Chef doesn't want to change the route he took before, so he simply has to find out how long it will take to reach his restaurant along his usual route. This route is given by a sequence of stations s0, s1, ..., sn where s0 is the station where the Chef enters the metro and sn is the station where the Chef exits the metro.\n\n\nTrains are scheduled to run between every two consecutive stations si-1 and si. Such a schedule is specified by three integers xi, li, and fi. This means that the first train on this line starts operating at time xi. The time it takes this train to travel from si-1 and si is exactly li units. Finally, a train departs from station si-1 every fi minutes following the previous train. That is, a train departs at time xi, xi+fi, xi+2fi, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe Chef is very experienced at navigating the metro so the time it takes him to transfer between trains at a given station  is essentially zero. Thus, if the Chef arrives at a station, say si, the moment that the train from si to si+1 is scheduled to depart, he skillfully hops on this next train. However, if the Chef arrives when no train to si+1 is scheduled to depart, he must wait until the scheduled departure time.\n\n\nHelp the Chef figure out how long it will take him to travel from station s0 to station sn. You may assume that the Chef is already at station s0 at time 0.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n between 1 and 1000 indicating the number of lines the Chef must traverse (so there are n+1 stations s0, s1, ..., sn). The next n lines describe the train schedules between stations, one per line. The i'th such line gives the values xi, li, and fi for the train that travels between stations si-1 and si.\n\n\nThe xi values will be between 0 and 1000 and the li and fi values will be between 1 and 1000.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single integer denoting the minimum time t for which the Chef can reach station sn using the given route.

Then\n\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |S|) denotes the i^th character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\nThe string T of the length M is called a substring of S if for some k from 0 to |S| - M we have \nT[1] = S[k + 1], T[2] = S[k + 2], ..., T[M] = S[k + M].\n\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains two integers K and N, the number of favorite lucky strings of the Little Elephant and the number of strings he has found under the pillow. Each of the following K lines contains one favorite lucky string. Namely, j^th line among these K lines contains the string Aj. Each of the following N lines contains one lucky string that was found under the pillow. Namely, i^th line among these N lines contains the string Bi. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.\n\nOutput\nFor each of the N strings that were found under the pillow print Good if it is good, and Bad otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 K, N \u2264 50\nFor each string S in the input file we have 1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 50.\nEach string in the input file consists only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.\n\n\nExample\n\n\nInput:\n2 4\n47\n744\n7444\n447\n7774\n77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774\n\nOutput:\nGood\nGood\nBad\nGood\n\n\n\nExplanation\nThe string S = 7444 is good since the favorite string 744 is its substring.\nThe string S = 447 is good since the favorite string 47 is its substring.\nThe string S = 7774 is bad since none of the favorite strings 47 and 744 is a substring of S.\nThe string S = 77777777777777777777777777777777777777777777774 is good since its length is 47. Note, however, that S does not have favorite substrings at all.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

An ingredient is represented by a letter 'a'-'z'. The i-th letter in a recipe denotes the i-th ingredient. An ingredient can be used multiple times in a recipe.\nThe technique is as follows. Compare two recipes by comparing their respective lists. If the sets of ingredients used in both recipes are equal and each ingredient is used the same number of times in both of them (processing order does not matter), they are declared as granama recipes. (\"granama\" is the Chef-ian word for \"similar\".)\nChef took two recipes he invented yesterday. He wanted to compare them using the technique. Unfortunately, Chef forgot to keep track of the number of times each ingredient has been used in a recipe. He only compared the ingredients but NOT their frequencies. More precisely, Chef considers two recipes as granama if there are no ingredients which are used in one recipe and not used in the other recipe.\nYour task is to report whether Chef has correctly classified the two recipes (as granama or not granama) although he forgot to keep track of the frequencies.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The Chef got it right!\nExample case 2: Chef declared them as granama recipes because both sets of ingredients are equal. But they are NOT granama since ingredient 'a' has been used twice in the first recipe but only once in the second. The Chef was incorrect!\nExample case 3: Chef declare them as not granama.

Obviously, Chef wants to give the kid less weight to carry.\nHowever, his son is a smart kid.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nIn the world of DragonBool there are fierce warriors called Soints. Also there are even fiercer warriors called Sofloats \u2013 the mortal enemies of Soints.\n\n\nThe power of each warrior is determined by the amount of chakra he possesses which is some positive integer. Warriors with zero level of chakra are dead warriors :) When the fight between Soint with power CI and Sofloat with power CF occurs the warrior with lower power will die and the winner will lose the amount of chakra that his enemy have possessed before the fight. So three cases are possible:\n\nCI > CF. Then Sofloat will die while the new power of Soint will be CI \u2013 CF.\nCI < CF. Then Soint will die while the new power of Sofloat will be CF \u2013 CI.\nCI = CF. In this special case both warriors die.\n\n\nEach warrior (Soint or Sofloat) has his level of skills which is denoted by some positive integer. The fight between two warriors can occur only when these warriors are Soint and Sofloat of the same level. In particual, friendly fights are not allowed, i.e., a Soint cannot fight with another Soint and the same holds for Sofloats.\n\n\nLets follow the following convention to denote the warriors. A Soint of level L and power C will be denoted as (I, C, L), while Sofloat of level L and power C will be denoted as (F, C, L). Consider some examples. If A = (I, 50, 1) fights with B = (F, 20, 1), B dies and A becomes (I, 30, 1). On the other hand, (I, 50, 1) cannot fight with (F, 20, 2) as they have different levels.\n\n\nThere is a battle between Soints and Sofloats. There are N Soints and M Sofloats in all. The battle will consist of series of fights. As was mentioned above in each fight one Soint and one Sofloat of the same level take part and after the fight the warrior with lower power will die (or both will die if they have the same power). The battle proceeds as long as there exists at least one pair of warriors who can fight. The distribution of warriors by levels satisfies the following condition: for every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa. So if for some level L we have at least one warrior of this level then there is at least one Soint of level L and at least one Sofloat of level L.\n\n\nThere is a powerful wizard, whose name is SoChef, on the side of Soints. He can increase the amount of chakra of each Soint by any number. SoChef wants the army of Soints to win this battle. But increasing amount of chakra of any Soint by one costs him a lot of his magic power. Hence he wants to minimize the total amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win. Note, however, that the win here means that all Sofloats should be dead irregardless of whether any Soint is alive. Also note that the battle can proceed by different scenarios and the SoChef need to distribute additional chakra among the Soints in such a way that they will win for any possible battle scenario. Help SoChef and find the minimal amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Here N is the number of Soints  participating in the battle and M is the number of Sofloats  for the same. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers  Ci and  Li, the amount of chakra and level of i-th Soint correspondingly. The next M lines describe power and level of Sofloats participating in the battle in the same format.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single integer on a single line, the minimum amount of chakra SoChef should give to Soints in order for them to win the battle.\n\n\nConstraints\nEach integer in the input file is positive and does not exceed 100. That is\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Ci \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Li \u2264 100\nFor every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa.\nIt is guaranteed that each official test file will satisfy all these constraints. You DON'T need to verify them in your program.\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n2 3\n10 1\n20 2\n5 2\n5 2\n18 1\n5 5\n73 87\n69 13\n36 36\n77 46\n43 93\n49 46\n74 93\n78 87\n99 13\n59 36\n\nOutput:\n8\n89\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1.\nThe warriors are I1 = (I, 10, 1), I2 = (I, 20, 2), F1 = (F, 5, 2), F2 = (F, 5, 2), F3 = (F, 18, 1). Without the SoChef help the battle can proceed as follows.\n\n\nI2 fights with F1, F1 dies, I2 becomes (I, 15, 2).\nI2 fights with F2, F2 dies, I2 becomes (I, 10, 2).\nI1 fights with F3, I1 dies, F3 becomes (F, 8, 1).\n\n\nSo if SoChef will give 8 additional units of chakra to I1 the Soints will win the battle and even one Soint (I2) will left alive. Hence the answer is 8.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Everyday Chef Juno comes up with new problems for her to solve, otherwise she gets bored and depressed. He doesn't want her to feel so, but he has run out of all problems. He consults his Chef friends, who came up with a new problem.\nThe Chef City is an N-dimensional city of dimensions L[0]*..*L[N-1] and each of the (L[0]*..*L[N-1]) cells may have 0 to V-1 restaurants. They want to know the number of ways they can open restaurants in each cell of the city such that the sum of the number of restaurants in every sub-block(see details) in Chef City is divisible by V.\nChef Juno realizes that this number could be very huge given the size of Chef City, so to make this problem a little easier for his girlfriend (and for himself, as he should himself know the solution ;)), he wants the answer modulo 1000000007. But before asking her this problem, he wants to know the answer himself. So he turns to you for help. Please help him :)\n\nDetails\nA sub-block of an N-dimensional hyperrectangle can be defined as an N-dimensional hyperrectangle of\n1*1*..L[i]..*1*1 dimensions for i ranging from 0 to N-1, where the ith dimension is L[i].\nFor example, in a 2*3*2 cuboid, we can have sub-blocks of\n2*1*1, 1*3*1 and 1*1*2 dimensions and each of the 12 cells can have\n0 to V-1 restaurants in such a way that the sum of the number of restaurants in every sub-block is divisible by V.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers V and N.\nSince the input file size may go large, we ask you to generate the input using the following scheme.\nYou have two lines of 6 integers each.\nThe first line consists of the integers P[0], P[1], A0, B0, C0, M0.\nThe second line consists of the integers Q[0], Q[1], A1, B1, C1, M1.\nUsing the above, you can generate arrays P[] and Q[] as follows:\nP[i] = A0 * A0 * P[i-1] + B0 * P[i-2] + C0 modulo (M0)\nQ[i] = A1 * A1 * Q[i-1] + B1 * Q[i-2] + C1 modulo (M1)\nfor i \u2265 2 and i < N\nFrom this, the ith dimension can be calculated as follows: \nThe ith dimension, L[i] = P[i]*(M1)+Q[i]+1 for i \u2265 0 and i < N\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nDevu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.\nDevu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.\nNow by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i \u2260 j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|^type.\nPlease help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer type, denoting the type of the cost function. Then the next line contains string s of length n, denoting the initial arrangement s of students.\nNote that the integer n is not given explicitly in input.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the answer of the test case, that is, the minimum cost to convert the current arrangement into a likable one. If it is not possible to convert the current arrangement into a likable one, then print -1 instead of the minimum cost.\n\nConstraints and Example\nInput:\n8\n0\nBB\n0\nBG\n0\nBBGG\n1\nBGG\n1\nBGGB\n1\nBBBGG\n2\nBBGG\n2\nBGB\n\nOutput:\n-1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n3\n1\n0\n\nExplanation\nNote type of the first 3 test cases is 0. So c(i, j) = 1. Hence we just have to count minimum number of swaps needed.\nExample case 1. There is no way to make sure that both the boys does not stand nearby. So answer is -1.\nExample case 2. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\nExample case 3. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is 1.\nNow type of the next 3 test cases is 1. So c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|, that is, the absolute value of the difference between i and j.\nExample case 4. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 5. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 6. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 4. After swap the arrangement will be BGBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |4 - 1| = 3.\nThen type of the last 2 test cases is 2. So c(i, j) = (j \u2212 i)^2\nExample case 7. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is (2 - 1)^2 = 1.\nExample case 8. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

In one of the rooms, the evil wazir has imprisoned\nthe princess. The noble prince is on his way to rescue the\nprincess.\nThe prince starts in the room at the top left corner of the grid,\nwhich is labelled (1,1).  Each room contains some guards.  It takes a\ncertain amount of time before the prince can kill all the guards in\nthe room he is in.  The time taken to kill the guards varies from room\nto room.  Once he has killed all the guards in a room, he can move on\nto any one of its neighbours by going left, right, up or down,\nprovided, of course, that there is a neighbouring room in the\ncorresponding direction.\nThe wazir, knowing that the prince is on his way, has set a time\nbomb that will kill the princess after T seconds.  You will\nbe given the position of the princess, the time left for the bomb to\ngo off and the time it takes for the prince to kill the guards in each\nof the rooms in the dungeon.  Your task is to determine if it is\npossible for the prince to reach the princess and save her by defusing\nthe bomb before the T seconds expire.\n For example, suppose the dungeon is described by the following\ngrid of numbers.\n2 3 2\n2 5 1\n5 3 1\n3 1 1\n\nThe number at position (i,j) indicates the time taken for\nthe prince to overpower the guards in room (i,j).

However, if\nT = 15, the prince can reach the princess with 4 seconds to\nspare, as follows.  Starting from (1,1), he moves right to (1,2) and\nthen (1,3), comes down all the way to (4,3) and then moves (4,2).  This\ntakes 11 seconds (note that he must also overpower the guard in the\nroom where the princess is incarcerated). You can check that he cannot\nreach the princess with more than 4 seconds to spare by any route.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers M and N indicating the number of rows and columns in the rectangular dungeon. Lines 2,3,\u2026,M+1 contain N positive integers. The jth integer on line i+1 is the time taken to overpower the guards at room (i,j). The last line in the input, line M+2, contains three integers a, b and T, where (a,b) is the position of the cell where the princess is held and T is the amount of time before the bomb goes off.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is not possible for the prince to save the princess then print a single line with the answer NO. Otherwise, print two lines. The first line should say YES. The second line should contain a single integer indicating the maximum possible time to spare when the prince rescues the princess.\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\nYou may assume that 1 \u2264 N,M \u2264 70.\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4 3 \n2 3 2\n2 5 1\n5 3 1\n3 1 1\n4 2 15\n\nOutput:\nYES\n4\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

It is quite large park that some tourists visit it more than once to fully appreciate its offerings. One day, our Chefs decided to visit the park. There are total n Chefs, i-th of them wants to visit the park ti times.\n\n\nUsually, the entry ticket for the park is very expensive. Today, being a weekend, park had an interesting offer for the visitors, \"1x Zahlen, 2x Spa\u00df\" (pay once, visit twice), i.e. you can get a second free visit after the first paid visit. The procedure for visiting the park and availing the offer is as follows.\n\nFirst time visitors should buy a ticket at the entrance of the park. Along with the ticket, you are offered an option of availing a voucher if you want a second visit.\nEnter the theme park, enjoy your visit. While returning make sure to sign your name in the voucher. Any unsigned voucher will not allowed to take out of the park.\nAfter the visit is done, the ticket counter takes back your ticket.\nIf it is your second time visit, then the counter will take back your voucher. No new voucher will be provided to you as you have already availed the offer.\nYou can avail the offer as many times as you wish in a day, i.e. offer is applicable for each visit with a paid ticket.\n\n\nObviously, this procedure has a flaw. The counter doesn't ask you to sign your name on the voucher at the time of providing it to make sure that the person buying the ticket is the one signing the voucher. So, if more than one Chefs enter the park, they can exchange their vouchers while they are inside the park.\n\n\nChefs thought of exploiting this flow. They wanted to buy minimum number of tickets. Can you help them in finding how many minimum tickets they should buy?\n\n\nLet us take an example. There are two Chef's, Alice and Bob. Alice wants to visit the park three times and Bob only once. For their first visits, each of them buys a ticket and obtains their vouchers and visits the park. After they have entered their park, Bob gives his voucher to Alice. Alice signs her name on her own voucher and on the voucher given by Bob. In this way, she has two vouchers, which she can use to visit the park two more times.

They are shocked! Indeed, neither expect to meet a colleague in such a place with the same intentions to carry away all the money collected during Churufest 2015.\n\n\nThey have carefully counted a total of exactly 1 billion (10^9) dollars in the bank vault. Now they must decide how to divide the booty. But there is one problem: the thieves have only M minutes to leave the bank before the police arrives. Also, the more time they spend in the vault, the less amount could carry away from the bank. Formally speaking, they can get away with all of the billion dollars right now, but after t minutes they can carry away only  1\u00a0billion\u00a0*\u00a0p^t dollars, where p is some non-negative constant less than or equal to unity, and at t = M, they get arrested and lose all the money.\nThey will not leave the vault until a decision on how to divide the money has been made.\n\nThe money division process proceeds in the following way: at the beginning of each minute starting from the 1^st (that is, t = 0), one of them proposes his own way to divide the booty. If his colleague agrees, they leave the bank with pockets filled with the proposed amounts of dollars. If not, the other one proposes his way at the next minute etc. To escape arrest, they can only propose plans till the beginning of the M^th minute (i.e., till t = M-1).\nEach thief wants to maximize his earnings, but if there are two plans with the same amounts for him, he would choose the one which leads to a larger total amount of stolen dollars.\n\nChef is about to start this procedure, and he is the first to propose a plan. You are wondering what will be the final division of money, if each thief chooses the optimal way for himself and money is considering real.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nAfter Chef successfully built a modern (L, K)-window on the attic wall he decided to expand the notion of the (L, K)-window in some other areas. Now he considers a rectangular grid that contains only zeroes and ones and has size N x M. He considers the (L, K)-window here as any submatrix of size L x K that contains only ones. Formally he defines (L, K)-window as any (K+L)-tuple (R1, ..., RL, C1, ..., CK) such that 1 <= R1 < ... < RL <= N, 1 <= C1  < ... < CK <= M and A[Ri][Cj]=1 for all 1 <= i <= L, 1<= j <= K. Here A[r][c] is the c-th element of the r-th row of considered rectangular grid.\n\nWhy does Chef call some (K+L)-tuple of numbers by the window? Just mark all points (Ri,Cj) (1 <= i <= L, 1<= j <= K) on the plane and join by line segments all pairs of points that has equal abscises or ordinates and you will see that this picture is like a window.\n\nNow Chef considers some particular N x M grid and wants to calculate the total number of (L, K)-windows in this rectangular grid. Help him. Since this number can be very large calculate the result modulo 1000000080798150871.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains four positive integers N, M, L, K, where L, N <= 1000, K, M <=3. Next N lines describe the rectangular grid considered by Chef. Each of these lines contains M symbols. Every symbol is either one or zero.\n\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the total number of (L, K)-windows for the given grid modulo 1000000080798150871.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n3 2 2 1\n11\n01\n10\n3 3 2 2\n111\n101\n111\n\nOutput:\n2\n5\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first case it is just the number of pairs of cells with value 1 that have the same column number.\n\nIn the second case we have the following (2, 2)-windows:\n\n(First row, Second row, First column, Third column)\n\n(First row, Third row, First column, Second column)\n\n(First row, Third row, First column, Third column)\n\n(First row, Third row, Second column, Third column)\n\n(Second row, Third row, First column, Third column)\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He also has L pairs of integers (ik, jk). His task is to calculate Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Mike forgot if Ai, j was a number in the i'th row and j'th column or vice versa, if Ai, j was a number in the j'th row and i'th column.\n\n\nSo, Mike decided to calculate both E1 = Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL and E2 = Aj1, i1 + Aj2, i2 + ... + AjL, iL. If it is impossible to calculate E1(i.e. one of the summands doesn't exist), then let's assume, that it is equal to -1. If it is impossible to calculate E2, then let's also assume, that it is equal to -1.\n\n\nYour task is to calculate max(E1, E2).\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.\nEach of next N lines contains M integers.

E1 = 2 + 5 = 7, E2 = 4 + 5 = 9. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(7, 9) = 9;\n\n\nIn the second test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1 and E2, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So the answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1, -1) = -1;\n\n\nIn the third test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So E1 is equal to -1. E2 = 1 + 3 = 4.

The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\n\nThe appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered.

A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\n\nThe Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2^k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\n\nYou are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow.

For a person to stay alive, he has to acquire at least L number of likes before D days pass.\n\n\n    People in this world employ various techniques to increase the number of likes. One of the famous ones is to dis-like and re-like their own article once per day. On doing so you can assume that the number of likes for the post increase by a constant factor C.\n\n\nSo if one starts with S likes on Day-1, he would have D2 = S + C * S likes on Day-2,    D3 = D2 + D2 * C on Day-3 etc. You are to answer if the person would survive at the end of Day-D or not.\n\n\nInput\n\n\n \n\n\n    First line contains a single positive integer T denoting the number of test cases.

'What can I do with them?' -- she asked herself. 'What if I try to find the longest string which is a subsequence of every string from the set?'. Ann spent a lot of time trying to solve the problem... but all her attempts happened to be unsuccessful. She then decided to allow the sought string to be an anagram of some subsequence of every string from the set. This problem seemed to be easier to Ann, but she was too tired to solve it, so Ann asked for your help.\n\nSo your task is, given a set of strings, to find the longest non-empty string which satisfies Ann.

He wants to place N colored cherries around the cake in a circular manner. As all great chefs do, Doom doesn't want any two adjacent cherries to have the same color. Chef has unlimited supply of cherries of K \u2264 10 different colors. Each color is denoted by the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K \u2013 1}. Different colors are denoted by different digits. Some of the cherries are already placed and the Chef wants you to place cherries in the remaining positions. He understands that there can be many such arrangements, so in the case when the answer is not unique he asks you to find the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nLet's numerate positions for the cherries by the numbers 1, 2, ..., N starting from one of the positions in a clockwise direction. Then the current (possibly partial) arrangement of the cherries can be represented by a string of N characters. For each position i of the arrangement if the cherry of the color C is placed at this position then the i^th character of the string is equal to the digit C. Otherwise, it is equal to the question mark ?. We identify the arrangement with the string that represents it.\n\n\nOne arrangement is called lexicographically smaller than the other arrangement if at the first position where they differ the first one has smaller digit (we compare only complete arrangements so we don't care about relation between digits and the question mark). For example, the arrangement 1230123 is lexicographically smaller than 1231230 since they have first 3 equal characters but the 4^th character in the first arrangement is 0 and it is less than 1 which is the 4^th character of the second arrangement.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n The cherries at the first and the last positions are adjacent to each other (recall that we have a circular cake).\n In the case N = 1 any arrangement is valid as long as the color used for the only cherry of this arrangement is less than K.\n Initial arrangement can be already invalid (see the case 3 in the example).\n\n\n\n\nJust to make all things clear. You will be given a usual string of digits and question marks. Don't be confused by circular stuff we have in this problem. You don't have to rotate the answer once you have replaced all question marks by the digits. Think of the output like the usual string for which each two consecutive digits must be different but having additional condition that the first and the last digits must be also different (of course if N > 1).\n\n\nNext, you don't have to use all colors. The only important condition is that this string should be lexicographically smaller than all other strings that can be obtained from the input string by replacement of question marks by digits and of course it must satisfy conditions on adjacent digits.\n\n\nOne more thing, K here is not the length of the string but the number of allowed colors. Also we emphasize that the given string can have arbitrary number of question marks. So it can have zero number of question marks as well as completely consists of question marks but of course in general situation it can have both digits and question marks.\n\n\nOK. Let's try to formalize things in order to make all even more clear. You will be given an integer K and a string S=S[1]S[2]...S[N] where each S[i] is either the decimal digit less than K or the question mark. We are serious. In all tests string S can have only digits less than K. Don't ask about what to do if we have digit \u2265 K. There are no such tests at all! We guarantee this! OK, let's continue. Your task is to replace each question mark by some digit strictly less than K. If there were no question marks in the string skip this step. Now if N=1 then your string is already valid. For N > 1 it must satisfy the following N conditions S[1] \u2260 S[2], S[2] \u2260 S[3], ..., S[N-1] \u2260 S[N], S[N] \u2260 S[1]. Among all such valid strings that can be obtained by replacement of question marks you should choose lexicographically smallest one. I hope now the problem is really clear.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly two lines. The first line contains an integer K, the number of available colors for cherries. The second line contains a string S that represents the current arrangement of the cherries in the cake.\n\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string S\nEach character in S is either the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K \u2013 1} or the question mark ?\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output the lexicographically smallest valid arrangement of the cherries in the cake that can be obtained from the given arrangement by replacement of each question mark by some digit from 0 to K \u2013 1. If it is impossible to place the cherries output NO (output is case sensitive).\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n7\n1\n?\n2\n?0\n10\n79259?087\n2\n??\n3\n0?1\n4\n?????\n3\n012\n\nOutput:\n0\n10\nNO\n01\n021\n01012\n012\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 2. The only possible replacement here is 10. Note that we output 10 since we can not rotate the answer to obtain 01 which is smaller.\n\n\nCase 3. Arrangement is impossible because cherries at the first and the last positions are already of the same color. Note that K = 10 but the string has length 9. It is normal. K and |S| don't have any connection.\n\n\nCase 4. There are two possible arrangements: 01 and 10. The answer is the first one since it is lexicographically smaller.\n\n\nCase 5. There are three possible ways to replace question mark by the digit: 001, 011 and 021. But the first and the second strings are not valid arrangements as in both of them there exists an adjacent pair of cherries having the same color. Hence the answer is the third string.\n\n\nCase 6. Note that here we do not use all colors. We just find the lexicographically smallest string that satisfies condition on adjacent digit.\n\n\nCase 7. The string is already valid arrangement of digits. Hence we simply print the same string to the output.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He got various orders to conduct the events from different organizations. In turn, Chef will receive a compensation depend upon the type of event and the total numbers of persons in the event. Chef has received N orders for conducting events in this weekend in all. As weekend consists of two days all events will take place during the period of 48 hours. For the i-th order the corresponding event will start at Si hours, ends at Ei hours and Chef will receive a compensation Ci for this event. For example, if Si = 17 and Ei = 22 then duration of event is 22 \u2013 17 = 5 hours and its time period is 17:00 \u2013 22:00 of Saturday. Hours of Sunday are numbered by numbers from 24 to 48. So, for example, 10:00 of Sunday will be represented as 10 + 24 = 34. Because Chef is a newbie, the organizations had put a condition that Chef will receive a compensation for the event if and only if he is available for the entire duration of the event. It means that he can not choose overlapping events. Note, however, that if some event starts just in the moment another event has finished the Chef can safely conduct them both.\n\n\nIn general Chef will obey the orders on first come first serve basis. But on weekends Chef will select the orders in such a way that the total compensation for all the events he will conduct will be the maximal. Now your task is to help Chef and find this maximal total compensation.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of received orders for conducting events. Each of the next N lines contains three space separated integers Si, Ei, Ci, the parameters of the i-th event described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000\n0 \u2264 Si < Ei \u2264 48\n0 \u2264 Ci \u2264 10^6\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput for each test case should contain a single integer in a separate line, the maximal compensation Chef Po can get.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4\n1 2 100\n2 3 200\n3 4 1600\n1 3 2100\n3\n1 10 2000\n2 5 100\n6 9 400\n\nOutput:\n3700\n2000\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. The best choice here is to conduct 3rd and 4th events. The total compensation is equal to 1600 + 2100 = 3700. These events do not overlap since 3rd event starts just after the finish of the 4th one. Alternatively we can conduct first three events that also do not overlap. But in this case compensation will be only 100 + 200 + 1600 = 1900.\n\n\nCase 2. Note that first event overlaps with both second and third events, while the last two events do not overlap. Hence there are two reasonable choices available for Chef. One is to take just the first order with total compensation 2000 and the second one is to take the last two orders with total compensation 100 + 400 = 500. Clearly the first choice is better. Hence the answer is 2000.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

All of these \n    players would stand in a circle in clock wise direction.\n    \n\n    There are an infinite number of long ropes available.\n    When a rope is held by exactly two players, it is termed as bonding.\n    \n\n    At least one bonding is necessary to conduct a game.\n    \n\n    A player can play against multiple people simultaneously i.e he can have more than one bonding at\n    the same time. \n    \n\n    Both members of a pair of players that have a bonding must have the same number of total\n    bondings.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nA tourist is visiting Byteland. The tourist knows English very well. The language of Byteland is rather different from English. To be exact it differs in following points:\n\nBytelandian alphabet has the same letters as English one, but possibly different in meaning. Like 'A' in Bytelandian may be 'M' in English. However this does not mean that 'M' in Bytelandian must be 'A' in English. More formally, Bytelindian alphabet is a permutation of English alphabet. It will be given to you and could be any possible permutation. Don't assume any other condition.\nPeople of Byteland don't like to use invisible character for separating words. Hence instead of space (' ') they use underscore ('_'). Other punctuation symbols, like '?', '!' remain the same as in English.\n\nThe tourist is carrying \"The dummies guide to Bytelandian\", for translation. The book is serving his purpose nicely. But he is addicted to sharing on BaceFook, and shares his numerous conversations in Byteland on it. The conversations are rather long, and it is quite tedious to translate for his English friends, so he asks you to help him by writing a program to do the same.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting the English translation of Bytelandian string \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\". T and M are separated by exactly one space. Then T lines follow, each containing a Bytelandian sentence S which you should translate into English. See constraints for details.\n\nOutput\nFor each of the sentence in the input, output its English translation on a separate line. Replace each underscores ('_') with a space (' ') in the output. Each punctuation symbol (see below) should remain the same. Note that the uppercase letters in Bytelandian remain uppercase in English, and lowercase letters remain lowercase. See the example and its explanation for clarity.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\nM is a permutation of \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\nEach sentence is non-empty and contains at most 100 characters\nEach sentence may contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), uppercase letters ('A'-'Z'), underscores ('_') and punctuation symbols: dot ('.'), comma (','), exclamation ('!'), question-mark('?')\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5 qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nPh\nPcssi\nBpke_kdc_epclc_jcijsc_mihyo?\nEpcf_kdc_liswhyo_EIED_hy_Vimcvpcn_Zkdvp_siyo_viyecle.\nIpp!\n\nOutput:\nHi\nHello\nWhat are these people doing?\nThey are solving TOTR in Codechef March long contest.\nOhh!\n\nExplanation\nThe string \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\" means that 'a' in Bytelandian is 'q' in English, 'b' in Bytelandian is 'w' in English, 'c' in Bytelandian is 'e' in English and so on.Thus to translate \"Ph\" (first sentence in example) to English:1) We find that 'p' in Bytelandian means 'h' in English. So we replace 'P' with 'H'.2) Then we see that 'h' in Bytelandian means 'i' in English. So we replace 'h' with 'i'.3) Therefore, the translation is \"Hi\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

At the same time, every player says one natural number. Let's call the number said by the i-th player Ai. The person with the smallest unique number (that is, the smallest number that was not said by anybody else) wins. Sometimes, there is a case when there are no unique numbers at all. Then the game is obviously a draw, so nobody wins it.\nSometimes, it's hard to determine the winner, especially, when the number of players is enormous. So in this problem, your assignment will be: given the names of the players and the numbers every of them have said. Please, tell the name of the winner, or determine that nobody wins.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of every test case consists of a single integer N - the number of players. Then, N lines will follow. Each of these N lines will consist of the player's name and the number Ai said by her, separated by a single space.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an answer to the corresponding test case - the name of the winner, or a string \"Nobody wins.\", if nobody wins the game.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5\nKouta 1\nYuka 1\nMayu 3\nLucy 2\nNana 5\n2\nLucy 2\nNana 2\n\nOutput:\nLucy\nNobody wins.\n\nScoring\nSubtask 1 (17 points): T = 10000, 1 <= N <= 10, 1 <= Ai <= 10 \nSubtask 2 (19 points): T = 10000, 1 <= N <= 10, 1 <= Ai <= 2*10^9\nSubtask 3 (30 points): T = 100, 1 <= N <= 1000, 1<= Ai <= 2*10^9\nSubtask 4 (34 points): T = 10, 1 <= N <= 10000, 1 <= Ai <= 2*10^9\nYou can safely assume that in all the test cases the length of any name will not exceed five letters.

For an example,\nlet us look at permutations.\nA permutation of the integers 1 to n is an\nordering of\nthese integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is\nto list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a\npermutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. \nHowever, there is another possibility of representing a permutation:\nYou create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the\nposition of the integer i in the permutation. \nLet us call this second\npossibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation\nfor the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAn ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be\ndistinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2\nfor example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same.\nTo get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a\nprogram which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.\n\n\nInput Specification\nThe input contains several test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000).\nThen a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows\nin the next line.

Recently, he made a pretty interesting discovery on palindromes and that made him feel really Lucky. He came across something known as Lucky Palindromes. He defines a string as being a lucky palindrome if it is a palindrome containing the string \"lucky\" as a substring. As always, now he wants to turn every string he comes across into a lucky palindrome. Being a chef, he is a man of patience and creativity, so he knows the operation of replacing any character of the string with any other character very well and he can perform this action infinitely many times. He wants you to write a program that can help him convert a given string to a lucky palindrome using the minimum number of operations and if several such lucky palindromes are possible, then output the lexicographically smallest one.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T <= 100 the number of testcases. The following T lines each contain a string of length <= 1000 and only containing characters 'a'-'z'.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each line of testcase, your program should output on a single line, the required lucky palindrome along with the minimum number of operations, both separated by a single space. If there is no lucky palindrome possible, then just output \"unlucky\" in a single line.\n\nExample:\n\nInput\n\n3\nlaubcdkey\nluckycodechef\naaaaaaaa\n\nOutput\n\nluckykcul 8\nluckycocykcul 6\nunlucky\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Having put their fortune to test and emerging victorious, they are now busy enjoying their wealth. Eugene wanted to drink it all away. Chef and Artem had better plans. \nChef and Artem decided to go to Las Vegas and put more of their fortune to test! Eugene stayed at home and continues drinking.\n\nIn Vegas, Chef and Artem found lots of interesting games. The most interesting one to them was the game of Lucky Tickets.\n\nLucky Tickets is played using three kinds of tickets\n\n\nType-1 called the winning ticket.\nType-2 called the losing ticket.\nType-3 called the try again ticket.\n\nLucky Tickets is played as follows\nYou know there are T1 tickets of Type-1, T2 tickets of Type 2 and T3 tickets of Type-3 before the game begins.\nAll the tickets are placed in a sealed box. You are allowed to take out only one ticket from the box. Of course, you cannot see inside the box while choosing the ticket.\n\n\nIf you choose a Type-1 ticket, you are declared winner of Lucky Tickets and double your money.\nIf you choose a Type-2 ticket, you are declared loser of Lucky Tickets and lose all your money.\nIf you choose a Type-3 ticket, you have to try your fortune again and pick another ticket from the box and the selection process starts all over again.\n\nChef was able to convince the organizers of Lucky Tickets to let him go first and discard T4 tickets. This means that Chef makes T4 turns to choose exactly one ticket every turn, and despite what ticket he chose, he simply discards it. Chef also convinced the organizers to let Artem go right after he is finished.\nWhat is the probability that Artem will win?\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case will consist of four space separeted integers T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the probability that Artem will win.

Probability of winning is 0 - since there are no winning tickets!\n(2,0,1) with probability (1/10). Probability of winning is 1 - since there are no losing tickets!\n(2,1,0) with probability (1/5). Probability of winning is (2/3) - there are no second chances!\n(1,2,0) with probability (1/5). Probability of winning is (1/3) - there are no second chances!\n(1,1,1) with probability (2/5). Probability of winning is (1/3) + (1/3)*(1/2) = (1/2). This is calculated by considering the two cases\n\nThe winning ticket is picked in the first turn - probability (1/3).\nA Type-3 ticket is picked in first turn, followed by the winning ticket - probability (1/3)*(1/2).\n\n\n\nThe over-all probability of winning is (1/10) + (2/15) + (1/15) + (1/5) = (1/2).\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef talks a lot on his mobile phone. As a result he exhausts his talk-value (in Rokdas) very quickly. One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas/minute). One of the plans said \"Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas/min for one month\". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month\u2019s usage.\nThere are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. Note - If a plan is valid for M months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every M months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T- the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains D- the default rate (Rokdas/minute, real number), U- the number of minutes Chef talked in last month and N- the number of add-on plans available. Then N lines follow, each containing M- the number of months the plan is valid for, R- the calling rate for the plan (Rokdas/minute, real number) and C- the cost of the plan.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one integer- the number of the best plan (from 1 to N). Output '0' if no plan is advantageous for Chef. No two plans are equally advantageous.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000.5 \u2264 D \u2264 10.0 (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)1 \u2264 U \u2264 100001 \u2264 N \u2264 1001 \u2264 M \u2264 360.05 \u2264 R < D (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)1 \u2264 C \u2264 1000\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n1.00 200 1\n1 0.50 28\n1.00 200 2\n1 0.75 40\n3 0.60 100\n1.00 50 2\n1 0.75 40\n3 0.60 100\n1.00 100 2\n3 0.50 10\n2 0.10 20\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n0\n2\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: This test case is same as the example in the problem statement.Test Case 2: This is for you to work out!Test Case 3: Chef's monthly usage is only 50 Rokdas and none of the 2 plans are advantageous, hence the answer is zero '0'.Test Case 4: Again solve it yourself, but NOTE - if Chef had chosen plan 1, he would have to pay 10 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 3 months and NOT every month. Similarly had he chosen plan 2, he would have to pay 20 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 2 months.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Now the factory is facing hard times, so currently they produce only the T-shirts of three kinds: red, green and blue T-Shirts. All the T-shirts are stored in the containers, each of the containers contain the T-Shirts of a single colour.\nNow there are N containers at the warehouse, lined up in a line. Let's enumerate the containers by the positive integers from 1 to N, starting from the leftmost and ending at the rightmost one. Their order is described with a string S. Each symbol of this string is either \"r\", \"g\" or \"b\" and denotes the colour of the respective T-shirts, stored in the container.\nOlya likes orderliness. She is not satisfied with the fact that different kinds of containers are messed up. So she wants to rearrange the containers in such a way that the number of pairs of adjacent containers that contain the T-shirts of different colors is as minimal as possible.\nFor doing that, she has a special crane. The crane is capable of doing the following things:\n\nTake a container with the number X and put it in front of all the containers. This operation takes (X-1) seconds. Note that we are considering the 1-dimensional model of the warehouse, so \"in front of all the containers\" means to the left of all the containers. The warehouse is so large, so you shouldn't worry about its' size and this operation is always performable.\nTake a container with the number X and take some container to the left of it (say, the container number Y). Remove the container number X from its' position and insert it right after the container with the number Y. This operation will take X-Y-1 seconds.\nTake a container with the number X and take some container to the right of it (say, the container number Y).

There are infinite number of unused cars, each of same model only differentiated by the their colors. The cars are of K colors.\n\n\nA zombie parent can give birth to any number of zombie-children (possibly zero), i.e. each zombie will have its parent except the head zombie which was born in the winters by combination of ice and fire.\n\n\nNow, zombies are having great difficulties to commute to their offices without cars, so they decided to use the cars available. Every zombie will need only one car. Head zombie called a meeting regarding this, in which he will allow each zombie to select a car for him.\n\n\nOut of all the cars, the head zombie chose one of cars for him. Now, he called his children to choose the cars for them. After that they called their children and so on till each of the zombie had a car. Head zombie knew that it won't be a good idea to allow children to have cars of same color as that of parent, as they might mistakenly use that. So, he enforced this rule during the selection of cars.\n\nProfessor James Moriarty is a criminal mastermind and has trapped Watson again in the zombie world. Sherlock somehow manages to go there and met the head zombie. Head zombie told Sherlock that they will let Watson free if and only if Sherlock manages to tell him the maximum number of ways in which the cars can be selected by N Zombies among all possible hierarchies. A hierarchy represents parent-child relationships among the N zombies. Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Sherlock can not compute big numbers, so he confides you to solve this for him.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of test-cases.\nEach test case consists of two space-separated integers N and K, denoting number of zombies and the possible number of colors of the cars respectively.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test-case, output a single line denoting the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput\n2\n2 2\n3 3\nOutput:\n2\n12\n\nExplanation\nIn the first sample test case, there are 2 zombies. Let us name them Z1 and Z2. Let one hierarchy be one in which Z1 is parent of Z2. There are 2 colors, suppose red and blue. If Z1 takes red, then Z2 should take a blue. If Z1 takes blue, then Z2 should take red. \nNote that one other possible hierarchy could be one in which Z2 is a parent of Z1. In that hierarchy also, number of possible ways of assigning cars is 2.\nSo there maximum number of possible ways is 2.\n\n\nIn the second example, we have 3 Zombies say Z1, Z2, Z3 and cars of 3 colors, suppose red, blue and green.\nA hierarchy to maximize the number of possibilities is Z1 is the parent of Z2, Z2 is the parent of Z3.\nZombie Z1 can choose one of red, blue or green cars. Z2 can choose one of the remaining two colors (as its car's color can not be same as its parent car.). Z3 can also choose his car in two colors, (one of them could be color same as Z1, and other being the color which is not same as cars of both Z1 and Z2.). This way, there can be 12 different ways of selecting the cars.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nKattapa, as you all know was one of the greatest warriors of his time. The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.\nKattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is \"lucky\" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and \"unlucky\" otherwise. He considered the army as \"READY FOR BATTLE\" if the count of \"lucky\" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of \"unlucky\" soldiers, and \"NOT READY\" otherwise.\nGiven the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" or \"NOT READY\".\nNote: You can find the definition of an even number here.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the i^th soldier is holding.\n\nOutput\nGenerate one line output saying \"READY FOR BATTLE\", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or \"NOT READY\" otherwise (quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 100\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\n1\n1\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExample 2\nInput:\n1\n2\n\nOutput:\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\nExample 3\nInput:\n4\n11 12 13 14\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExample 4\nInput:\n3\n2 3 4\n\nOutput:\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\nExample 5\nInput:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExplanation\n\n\nExample 1: For the first example, N = 1 and the array A = [1]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 2: For the second example, N = 1 and the array A = [2]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 3: For the third example, N = 4 and the array A = [11, 12, 13, 14]. The 1^st soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4^th soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an equal number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not strictly greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 4: For the fourth example, N = 3 and the array A = [2, 3, 4]. The 1^st soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2^nd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3^rd soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 5: For the fifth example, N = 5 and the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The 1^st soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4^th soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5^th soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

I guess its hard to code while thinking of Samosa, especially if you are very hungry now ; so lets not get in to any recipe or eating game. \n\nYou have N  boxes of Samosas, where each box is a cube. To pack a box, you need to use a rubber band ( pseudo-circular, elastic band ) by placing it around the box ( along 4 faces of the cube ).  A (R1,R2)-rubber band has initial radius R1 and it can stretch at max to radius R2 without breaking. You can pack a cubical box of side length L using a rubber band of circumference 4 * L ( see Notes for clarity). Given M rubber bands along with their initial radius and max radius, we need to match ( assign ) some rubber bands to boxes. A box needs at least one rubber band to pack it and of course, each rubber band can be used to pack at most one box. Find the maximum number of boxes we can pack.\n\n\nNotesA pseudo-circular rubber band having a radius R has circumference of 2 * K * R , where K is a constant = 22 / 7. So, a (R1,R2) rubber band can be used to pack a cubical box of side length L, only if 2 * K * R1 <= 4 * L <= 2 * K * R2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 20 ). T cases follow. Each test case starts with an integer N ( number of boxes, 1 <= N <= 1000 ). Next line contains N integers, the side lengths L of the N boxes ( 1 <= L <= 100,000,000 ). Next line contains an integer M ( number of rubber bands, 1 <= M <= 1000 ). Each of the next M lines contains two integers R1 R2 ( 1 <= R1 <= R2 <= 100,000,000 ), separated by a space.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of boxes you can pack, in a new line.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n1\n4\n10 20 34 55\n4\n7 14\n7 21\n14 21\n7 35\n\nOutput:\n2\n\n\nExplanation:\nOnly 1 test case here, and a possible answer can be, using (7,14) rubber band to pack box L = 10, and using (7,35) rubber band to pack box L = 55. We cannot pack more than 2 boxes.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

To make matters worse Taru's brother who is really naughty tears of some of the pages of \n\nthe Magazine and throws them in the dustbin. He remembers the number of leaves he had torn but he does not remember which page numbers got removed. When Taru \n\nfinds this out he is furious and wants to beat him up. His brother apologizes, and says he won't ever do this again. But Taru did not want to be easy on him \n\nand he says \"I will leave you only if you help me find the answer to this. I will tell you how many pages (Printed sides) were there in the Magazine plus the \n\npages on which the page numbers were not printed. You already know the number of leaves you tore (T). Can you tell me the expected sum of the page numbers \n\nleft in the Magazine?\" Taru's brother replied \"huh!! This is a coding problem\". Please help Taru's brother.\n\nNote: The magazine is like a standard book with all odd page numbers in front and the successive even page number on its back. If the book contains 6 pages, \n\nPage number 1 and Page number 2 are front and back respectively. Tearing a leaf removes both the front and back page numbers.\n\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains the number of test cases t. 3t lines follow. The first line of each test case contains the number of pages (printed sides) in the \n\nbook. The second line's first integer is F, F integers follow which tell us the numbers of the page numbers not printed. The third line contains a single integer telling us the number of leaves Taru's brother tore.\n\n\nOutput\nOutput one real number correct up to 4 decimal digits which is equal to the expected sum of the page numbers left in the book.\n\n\nConstraints\n\nNumber of printed Sides<=2000. All other values abide by the number of printed sides.\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n10\n2 1 2\n2\n10\n1 8\n0\n\nOutput:\n31.2000\n47.0000\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He currently faces a large block of height N cells and length N cells, and needs to get his tractor across this block. The block is made up of vertical columns of soil, each of which is one cell long. Each column has a continuous vertical gap, with the i^th column having its gap from the li^th cell to the hi^th cell (starting from the bottom, 0-indexing). That is, in the i^th column, there is no soil from the li^th cell to the hi^th cell (both inclusive). Chef can build additional gaps by clearing some cells of soil. His tractor has height H, and therefore, he needs to build a horizontal corridor of height H passing through all the columns. That is, some consecutive H rows must have no soil. Please see the figures in the example and explanation sections for more details.\nChef is able to clear one cell of soil by spending one unit of energy. Chef is smart, and will figure out a way to build the horizontal corridor while spending the minimum possible amount of energy.

They are tied versus Chelsea, which is a very defending team that usually relies on counter-strike to catch opposing teams off guard and we are in the last minute of the match. So Messi decided to settle things down for good and now he is conducting the ball on his teams' midfield and he will start a lethal counter-attack :D\nAfter dribbling the 2 strikers from Chelsea, he now finds himself near the center of the field and he won't be able to dribble the entire team on his own, so he will need to pass the ball to one of his teammates, run forward and receive the ball once again to score the final goal.\nExactly K players are with him on his counter-attack and the coach, Tito Villanova knows that this counter-attack will end in a goal only if after exactly N passes are performed between the players, Messi ends up with the ball.\n (Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi after exactly N passes are performed between all the K+1 players, i.e. Messi can receive the ball several times during the N passes. See the 2nd test case explanation for further clarification. ) \nHowever, he realized that there are many scenarios possible for this, so he asked you, his assistant coach, to tell him in how many ways can Messi score the important victory goal. So help him!!\n\nInput\nInput will contain a number T denoting the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow, each one consisting of two space-sparated integers N and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways the winning play might happen modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n2 4\n4 2\n\nOutput:\n4\n6\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, say four players with Messi are Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Jordi Alba. Then the ways of the winning play to happen when exactly  2 passes are to be performed are:1) Messi - Xavi - Messi2) Messi - Busquets - Messi3) Messi - Iniesta - Messi4) Messi - Alba - Messi \nIn the second test case, also say that two players with Messi are Xavi and Iniesta. There are 6 ways for the winning play to happen when exactly 4 passes are performed. All the examples of such winning play are:1) Messi - Xavi - Messi - Iniesta - Messi2) Messi - Xavi - Iniesta - Xavi - Messi3) Messi - Xavi - Messi - Xavi - Messi4) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Iniesta - Messi5) Messi - Iniesta - Messi - Xavi - Messi6) Messi - Iniesta - Xavi - Iniesta - Messi\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nThe Little Elephant and his friends from the Zoo of Lviv were returning from the party. But suddenly they were stopped by the policeman Big Hippo, who wanted to make an alcohol test for elephants.\nThere were N elephants ordered from the left to the right in a row and numbered from 0 to N-1. Let R[i] to be the result of breathalyzer test of i-th elephant.\nConsidering current laws in the Zoo, elephants would be arrested if there exists K consecutive elephants among them for which at least M of these K elephants have the maximal test result among these K elephants.\nUsing poor math notations we can alternatively define this as follows. The elephants would be arrested if there exists i from 0 to N-K, inclusive, such that for at least M different values of j from i to i+K-1, inclusive, we have R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ..., R[i+K-1]}.\n\nThe Big Hippo is very old and the Little Elephant can change some of the results. In a single operation he can add 1 to the result of any elephant. But for each of the elephants he can apply this operation at most once.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations that the Little Elephant needs to apply, such that the sequence of results, after all operations will be applied, let elephants to avoid the arrest? If it is impossible to avoid the arrest applying any number of operations, output -1.\n\nInput\n The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K, M. The second line contains N space-separated integers  R[0], R[1], ..., R[N-1] denoting the test results of the elephants.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of operations needed to avoid the arrest.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 K \u2264 N \u2264 17\n1 \u2264 R[i] \u2264 17\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n5 3 2\n1 3 1 2 1\n5 3 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n5 3 3\n7 7 7 8 8\n4 3 1\n1 3 1 2\n\nOutput:\n0\n1\n1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Let's follow the poor math definition of arrest. We will consider all values of i from 0 to N-K = 2, inclusive, and should count the number of values of j described in the definition. If it less than M = 2 then this value of i does not cause the arrest, otherwise causes.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{1, 3, 1}\nmax = 3\nR[j] = 3 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{3, 1, 2}\nmax = 3\nR[j] = 3 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{1, 2, 1}\nmax = 2\nR[j] = 2 for j = 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that initial test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant does not need to apply any operations. Therefore, the answer is 0.\nExample case 2.We have N = 5, K = 3, M = 3. Let's construct similar table as in example case 1. Here the value of i will cause the arrest if we have at least 3 values of j described in the definition.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 0, 1, 2\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 1, 2, 3\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 2, 3, 4\ncauses the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that for initial test results of the elephants each value of i causes their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant needs to apply some operations in order to avoid the arrest. He could achieve his goal by adding 1 to the result R[2]. Then results will be {R[0], R[1], R[2], R[3], R[4]} = {7, 7, 8, 7, 7}. Let's check that now elephants will be not arrested.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 8, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{8, 7, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that now test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Thus we see that using 0 operations we can't avoid the arrest but using 1 operation can. Hence the answer is 1.\nExample case 3.We have N = 5, K = 3, M = 3. Let's construct similar table as in example case 1. Here the value of i will cause the arrest if we have at least 3 values of j described in the definition.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 0, 1, 2\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 8, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3, 4\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that for initial test results of the elephants the value of i = 0 causes their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant needs to apply some operations in order to avoid the arrest. He could achieve his goal by adding 1 to the result R[1]. Then results will be {R[0], R[1], R[2], R[3], R[4]} = {7, 8, 7, 8, 8}. Let's check that now elephants will be not arrested.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 8, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{8, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 1, 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 8, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3, 4\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that now test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Thus we see that using 0 operations we can't avoid the arrest but using 1 operation can. Hence the answer is 1. Note that if we increase by 1 the result R[2] instead of R[1] then the value i = 2 will cause the arrest since {R[2], R[3], R[4]} will be {8, 8, 8} after this operation and we will have 3 values of j from 2 to 4, inclusive, for which R[j] = max{R[2], R[3], R[4]}, namely, j = 2, 3, 4.\nExample case 4. When M = 1 the Little Elephant can't reach the goal since for each value of i from 0 to N-K we have at least one value of j for which R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ..., R[i+K-1]}.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nThis summer, there is a worldwide competition being held in Chef Town and some of the best chefs of the world are participating. The rules of this competition are quite simple.\n\n Each participant needs to bring his or her best dish. The judges will initially assign a score to each of the dishes. Now, several rounds will follow. In each round, any two chefs will be called up on the stage. Each of the chefs can then choose any one dish to battle against the other chef and the one having the dish with the higher score will win this round. The winner of the round will also obtain all the dishes of the loser who will then be eliminated. In case both the dishes have equal scores, this round will be considered as a tie and nothing else will happen. Note that initially each chef will have only one dish and all the chefs play the rounds optimally.\n\n Your task is to simulate and answer some queries related to this. You will be given N dishes numbered from 1 to N with the i^th dish belonging to the i^th chef initially. You will also be given an array S where S[i] denotes the score given by the judges to the i^th dish before starting the rounds. You will have to answer Q queries, each of which can be of the following types :  \n1.  0 x y : This denotes that the chef containing dish number x  competes with the chef containing dish number  y  currently in this round. If a single chef is the owner of both the dishes, print \"Invalid query!\" (without quotes), otherwise execute and store the result of this round as described by the rules above.  \n2.  1 x  : You need to output the index of the chef containing dish x  at this point.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer N denoting the number of chefs in the contest. The next line contains N space separated integers where the i^th integer represents S[i]. The next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.  Q  lines follow where each line can be of the format  0 x y  or  1 x  as described in the problem statement. \n\nOutput\n For each test, print in each line the answer for the queries as described in the problem statement .\n\nConstraints\n\n 1 \u2264 T \u2264 25 \n 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10000(10^4) \n 0 \u2264 S[i] \u2264 1000000(10^6)\n 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10000(10^4)\n 1 \u2264 x, y \u2264  N\n\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2\n1 2\n2\n0 1 2\n1 1\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nThere are two chefs with scores of dishes  1  and  2  respectively. After the first query, chef  2  acquires dish  1  since  S[2] > S[1] . Hence, the answer for the second query, i.e owner of the first dish is chef 2.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

They would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers. However, we all know that Baahubali and Bhallaladeva defeated the Kalakeyas by following the Thrishul strategy, and successfully defended their kingdom Maahishmati. We also know that Baahubali was very smart, and the truth is that he predicted how the Kalakeyas would attack and  devised a counter strategy for the same, the night before the war. This is what he found:\nThe Kalakeyas had N forts, numbered 1 to N and Baahubali had N soldiers, numbered 1 to N. Baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of 1 to N => P1, P2, ..., PN. He would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way: soldier P1 attacks fort 1, soldier P2 attacks fort 2, ..., soldier PN attacks fort N. It is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort. Baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the Kalakeyas, which is an integer K. A soldier X can destroy a fort Y, iff abs(X - Y) \u2265 K. For more details on the abs() function, check here.\n\nYour task is to determine whether Baahubali's soldiers can be permuted in some way, such that all forts can be destroyed. In other words, for a permutation P1, P2, ..., PN, Baahubali's soldiers can destroy all the forts iff abs(Pi - i) \u2265 K, for all 1 <= i <= N. If this is possible, you are also required to output the lexicographically smallest such permutation. If it is not possible, output -1.\n\nNote: A permutation A1, A2, ..., AN is said to be lexicographically smaller than a permutation B1, B2, ..., BN, if and only if at the first i where Ai and Bi differ, Ai comes before Bi. You can refer here for a more detailed definition of lexicographic ordering.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

It is impossible to permute [1, 2] in any way such that abs(P[1]-1) \u2265 2 and abs(P[2]-2) \u2265 2. Hence, output is -1.\nFor the second test case, N = 3 and K = 0. We can just set P[i] = i, and hence the answer is 1 2 3\nFor the third case, the valid permutations are [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2].

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef has bought N robots to transport cakes for a large community wedding. He has assigned unique indices, from 1 to N, to each of them. How it will happen?\nChef arranges the N robots in a row, in the (increasing) order of their indices. Then, he chooses the first M robots and moves them to the end of the queue. Now, Chef goes to the robot at the first position in the row and hands it one cake. He then notes this robot's index (say k) in his notebook, and goes to the k^th position in the row. If the robot at this position does not have a cake, he give him one cake, notes his index in his notebook, and continues the same process. If a robot visited by Chef already has a cake with it, then he stops moving and the cake assignment process is stopped.\nChef will be satisfied if all robots have a cake in the end. In order to prepare the kitchen staff for Chef's wrath (or happiness :) ), you must find out if he will be satisfied or not? If not, you have to find out how much robots have a cake, so that the kitchen staff can prepare themselves accordingly.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe single line of each test cases contains two space separated integers N and M.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each of the T test cases, output a single line:\n\nIf all N robots have a cake, output \"Yes\" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, output \"No\" (without quotes) followed by a space and the number of robots which have a cake.\n\n\nConstraints and Example\nInput:\n3\n2 0\n2 1\n4 2\n\nOutput:\nNo 1\nYes\nNo 2\n\n\nExplanation\nIn test case 1, we have two robots indexed 1 and 2. They are arranged as (1 2). Chef goes to the first robot, gives him a cake, and moves to position 1. In the next step, he sees that robot at this position already has a has cake. So Chef stops moving, and our answer is \"No 1\".\nIn test case 2, we again have two robots indexed 1 and 2. Initially, they are arranged as (1 2). Then, Chef moves robot#1 to the end of the row, and thus the arrangement becomes (2 1). Chef goes to the robot at the first position, which is robot#2. Chef hands him a cake, and moves to position 2. Then, he hands a cake to robot#1 at position 2, and moves back to the first position. Since, robot#2 at the first position already ahs a cake, Chef stops moving. All N robots have cakes, so Chef is satisfied, and our answer is \"Yes\".\nIn the 3^rd test case, we have the following arrangement of robots: (3 4 1 2). Only robots with indices 3 and 1 will get cakes. So our answer is \"No 2\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The time shown above (3:33) is an example of such a situation. Other examples are 2:2 and 1:11. Note that the digits of 33:33 are identical, but it is not a valid time on a usual digital clock.\nThe above example was for a usual 24-hour format digital clock. Let's consider a more general clock, where an hour lasts M minutes and a day lasts H hours (therefore, the clock can show any number of hours between 0 and H-1, inclusive, and any number of minutes between 0 and M-1, inclusive). Both the hours and the minutes are shown without leading zeroes in decimal notation and their separator (e.g., ':') doesn't matter.\nCan you tell how many minutes during a day will the digital clock have identical digits displayed on it?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.\nEach of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers H and M for one test case.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line corresponding to the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n1 \u2264 H, M \u2264 100\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n6\n24 60\n34 50\n10 11\n10 12\n11 11\n1 1\n\nOutput:\n19\n20\n10\n11\n10\n1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. A clock shows two identical digits at times 0:0, 1:1, .., 9:9, three identical digits at times 11:1, 22:2, 1:11, 2:22, 3:33, 4:44, 5:55, and four identical digits at times 11:11 and 22:22. So, there are 19 minutes during which the time displayed by the clock will have identical digits. \nExample case 2. Compared to the previous case, the clock doesn't show 5:55, but can show 33:3 and 33:33.\nExample case 6. In this example, our day consists of one hour and one hour consists of one minute. Hence, the entire day is just 1 minute - the only time the digital clock will display is 0:0 during the entire day, (i.e. the entire hour, i.e. entire minute). And 0:0 has all digits identical, so the answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

With the help of this stone, he can multiply a number by any lucky number. Also, the magic stone can be used any number of times (possibly zero or infinite number of times). For example, if initially he has the number 1, then he can get numbers like 28 (formed by 1*4*7), 14476 (formed as 1*47*77*4) etc.\nNa2a has N numbers in his bag which are denoted by array A. For each number Ai in his bag, he asks you to transform it to a number with maximum possible number of trailing zeroes by using Magic Stone. You have to find the smallest of such numbers, since there can be multiple numbers with the maximum possible number of trailing zeros.\n\nInput\n\nThere is a single test case.\nFirst line contains a single integer N as stated in the problem.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN where Ai denotes the i^th number in the bag.\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput N lines, in which i^th line contains the answer corresponding to the number Ai.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^9 \n\n\nExample\nInput:\r\n2\r\n2 15\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n2\r\n60\r\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

He discovered that the best way to train finger speed is to play scales.\nThere are different kinds of scales which are divided on the basis of their interval patterns. For instance, major scale is defined by pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S, where \u2018T\u2019 stands for a whole tone whereas \u2018S\u2019 stands for a semitone. Two semitones make one tone. To understand how they are being played, please refer to the below image of piano\u2019s octave \u2013 two consecutive keys differ by one semitone.\nIf we start playing from first key (note C), then we\u2019ll play all white keys in a row (notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C \u2013 as you can see C and D differ for a tone as in pattern, and E and F differ for a semitone).\nThis pattern could be played some number of times (in cycle).\n\nEach time Chef takes some type of a scale and plays using some number of octaves. Sometimes Chef can make up some scales, so please don\u2019t blame him if you find some scale that does not exist in real world.\nFormally, you have a set of 12 keys (i.e. one octave) and you have N such sets in a row. So in total, you have 12*N keys. You also have a pattern that consists of letters 'T' and 'S', where 'T' means move forward for two keys (from key x to key x + 2, and 'S' means move forward for one key (from key x to key x + 1).\nNow, you can start playing from any of the 12*N keys. In one play, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you want, but you cannot go outside the keyboard.\nRepeating pattern means that if, for example, you have pattern STTST, you can play STTST as well as STTSTSTTST, as well as STTSTSTTSTSTTST, as well as any number of repeating. For this pattern, if you choose to repeat it once, if you start at some key x, you'll press keys: x (letter 'S')-> x + 1 (letter 'T')-> x + 3 (letter 'T')-> x + 5 (letter 'S') -> x + 6 (letter 'T')-> x + 8. Also 1 \u2264 x, x + 8 \u2264 12*N so as to avoid going off the keyboard.\nYou are asked to calculate number of different plays that can be performed. Two plays differ if and only if they start at different keys or patterns are repeated different number of times.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains scale\u2019s pattern \u2013 string s consisting of letters \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 only.\nSecond line contains one integer N \u2013 number of octaves he\u2019ll be using.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single number in a line corresponding to number of different scales he\u2019ll play.\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2 \nTTTT\n1\nTTSTTTS\n3\n\nOutput:\n4\n36\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

The color of i-th part Ci will be equal to 'R' if the color of the part is red and 'G' if it is green.\n\n\nJohn decided to paint the whole fence in green color. To make the mundane process of painting more entertaining he decided to do it using the following process.\nEvery minute (until the whole fence is painted green) he will do the following steps:\n\n\nChoose any part of the fence that is painted red.

Suddenly, when Chef was absent, one naughty boy came and divided the tangerine into p parts (also by separating the neighbouring segments one from another): the 1^st - from segment a1 to segment b1, the 2^nd - from a2 to b2, ..., the p^th - from ap to bp (in all cases in the clockwise order). Chef became very angry about it! But maybe little boy haven't done anything wrong, maybe everything is OK? Please, help Chef to determine whether he is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have (in order to do it he can divide p current parts, but, of course, he can't join several parts into one).\n Please, note that parts are not cyclic. That means that even if the tangerine division consists of only one part, but that part include more than one segment, there are two segments which were neighbouring in the initial tangerine but are not neighbouring in the division.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef Ciel wants to put a fancy neon signboard over the entrance of her restaurant. She has not enough money to buy the new one so she bought some old neon signboard through the internet. Ciel was quite disappointed when she received her order - some of its letters were broken. But she realized that this is even better - she could replace each broken letter by any letter she wants. So she decided to do such a replacement that the resulting signboard will contain the word \"CHEF\" as many times as possible.\nWe can model the signboard as a string S having capital letters from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, and question marks '?'. Letters in the string indicate the intact letters at the signboard, while question marks indicate broken letters. So Ciel will replace each question mark with some capital letter and her goal is to get the string that contains as many substrings equal to \"CHEF\" as possible. If there exist several such strings, she will choose the lexicographically smallest one.\nNote 1. The string S = S1...SN has the substring \"CHEF\" if for some i we have SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = \"CHEF\". The number of times \"CHEF\" is the substring of S is the number of those i for which SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = \"CHEF\".\nNote 2. The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. In particular, A is lexicographically smaller than B if A1 < B1. We compare capital letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'A' is the smallest letter, 'B' is the second smallest letter, ..., 'Z' is the largest letter.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a string S.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the content of the signboard Chef Ciel will come up with. That is you should output the lexicographically smallest string that could be obtained from the input string by replacing all its question marks by some capital letters and having as many substrings equal to \"CHEF\" as possible.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 2013\n1 \u2264 length of S \u2264 2013\nEach character in S is either a capital letter from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, or the question mark '?'.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\n????CIELIS???E?\n????CIELISOUR???F\nT?KEITE?SY\n????????\n???C???\n\nOutput:\nCHEFCIELISACHEF\nCHEFCIELISOURCHEF\nTAKEITEASY\nCHEFCHEF\nAAACHEF\n\nExplanation \nExample Case 1. Here the resulting string can have at most 2 substrings equal to \"CHEF\". For example, some possible such strings are:\n\nCHEFCIELISACHEF\nCHEFCIELISQCHEF\nCHEFCIELISZCHEF\n\nHowever, lexicographically smallest one is the first one.\nExample Case 3. Here the resulting string cannot have \"CHEF\" as its substring. Therefore, you must simply output the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from the given one by replacing question marks with capital letters.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nYou are in charge of painting the lanes on a 500 meter race track for a forthcoming amateur track event. There are 9 lanes in total which means you must paint 10 lines around the track to delimit these lanes. Fortunately, you have special equipment that will help you paint these lanes very quickly.\n\n\nThis equipment has 10 paint nozzles arranged in a line and the spacing between consecutive nozzles is exactly equal to the width of a lane. So, all you have to do is drag this equipment around the track once while all 10 nozzles are spraying to paint all of the lines that delimit the lanes.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the equipment is a old and the paint doesn't apply evenly. Specifically, an air bubble can appear in a nozzle's paint supply line causing the nozzle to spray air instead of paint for a while. Since this event is not professional, it is ok to have some parts of the lines missing as long as each racer always has one of its two sides painted at any point on the track.\n\n\nYou only realized this after you finished dragging the equipment around the track. The equipment has some basic computing power and sensors and it was able to record when a nozzle was not working properly due to a paint bubble. So, instead of walking over the entire track, you can analyze the data. Your boss wants to know precisely how many meters out of the 500 meters of the race track are such that every lane has at least one of its sides painted along that meter.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T \u2264 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a single integer B indicating the number of bubbles that were recorded by the equipment's computer.\n\n\nThen B lines follow with 0 \u2264 B \u2264 300, each describing a single bubble. A bubble is described by three integers S, E, L where S is the meter of the track where the bubble first appeared and E is the meter of the track when the bubble disappeared. This means that paint is not applied from meter S through to, and including, meter E. This bubble appears on paint line L. Here, 1 \u2264 S \u2264 E \u2264 500 and 0 \u2264 L \u2264 9.\n\n\nFor example, if a bubble starts at meter 12 and ends at meter 15 on paint line 3, then there is no paint appearing on line number 3 over meters 12, 13, 14, and 15. In total, 4 meters of the line are not painted due to this particular bubble.\n\n\nSay the lanes are numbered from 1 to 9. Then lane 1 is delimited by lines 0 and 1, lane 2 by lines 1 and 2, lane 3 by lines 2 and 3, and so on. Also, the input will be such that no two bubbles in the same paint line share a common meter of the track. That is, if S,E and S',E' are the start and endpoints of two different bubbles on a common line L, then either E < S' or E' < S.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of a single integer on a single line. This integer is the number of meters (out of 500) are such that every one of the 9 lanes on the track has at least one of the lines delimiting that lane fully painted throughout that meter.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n2\n1 3 1\n2 5 2\n2\n1 3 1\n2 5 3\n5\n60 60 4\n60 61 5\n61 61 6\n100 100 8\n100 100 9\n\nOutput:\n498\n500\n497\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef is the head of commercial logging industry that recently bought a farm containing N trees. You are given initial height of the i-th tree by Hi and the rate of growth of height as Ri meters per month. For simplicity, you can assume that all the trees are perfect cylinders of equal radius. This allows us to consider only the height of trees when we talk about the amount of wood.\n\n\nIn Chef's country, laws don't allow one to cut a tree partially, so one has to cut the tree completely for gathering wood. Also, laws prohibit cutting trees of heights (strictly) lower than L meters.\n\n\nToday Chef received an order of W meters (of height) of wood. Chef wants to deliver this order as soon as possible. Find out how minimum number of months he should wait after which he will able to fulfill the order. You can assume that Chef's company's sawing machines are very efficient and take negligible amount of time to cut the trees.\n\n\nInput\nThere is a single test case per test file.\nThe first line of the input contains three space separated integers N, W and L denoting the number of trees in the farm, the amount of wood (in meters) that have to be gathered and the minimum allowed height of the tree to cut.\nEach of next N lines contain two space separated integers denoting Hi and Ri respectively.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer denoting the number of months that have to pass before Chef will be able to fulfill the order.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 W, L \u2264 10^18\n1 \u2264 Hi, Ri \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3 74 51\n2 2\n5 7\n2 9\n\nOutput:\n7\n\nExplanation\nAfter 6 months, heights of each tree will be 14, 47 and 56 respectively. Chef is allowed to cut only the third tree, sadly it is not enough to fulfill an order of 74 meters of wood.\nAfter 7 months, heights of each tree will be 16, 54 and 65 respectively. Now Chef is allowed to cut second and third trees. Cutting both of them would provide him 119 meters of wood, which is enough to fulfill the order.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

A discussion of possible approaches to solving this problem can be found in our blog.\nOne evening Johnny found some funny looking beens in his grandfather's garden shed, and decided to plant one of them. Next morning, to his surprise he found an enormous beanstalk growing in his back yard. Undaunted by its size, he decided to count its leaves.\n\nYou must know that beanstalks in Byteland grow in a very special way. At the lowest (1st) level, there is exactly one stem. At any level(including the 1st), a stem can end (forming exactly one leaf), or branch into exactly two stems which grow into the next level, following the same rules.\n\nJohnny believes he has managed to count the number of leaves at each of the levels of the beanstalk. However, you must know that before he began to count, Johnny ate one or two of the other beans he found in his grandfather's shed, and that's why he is not quite sure of his results. Please verify whether Johnny's results may possibly be correct, at least in theory.\n\n\n\nInput\nThe input starts with a line containing integer t, the number of test cases (1 \u2264 t \u2264 20). The descriptions of exactly t test cases follow.\nEach test case starts with an integer k, representing the number of levels of the beanstalk (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6). The next k non-negative space-separated integers (not greater than 10^6) represent the number of leaves of the beanstalk at successive levels, starting from level 1.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing exactly one of the words 'Yes' or 'No', depending on whether a beanstalk having the stated leaf counts can grow in accordance with the Bytelandian rules.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n3\n0 1 2\n3\n0 0 3\n\nOutput:\nYes\nNo\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation.\nSergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well.\nIn order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, the maximal number of students who'll get enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively.\nThe following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams conducted. The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller.\nThe last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to be enrolled. If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output \"Impossible\" (without quotes).\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n1 \u2264 K < N \u2264 10^4\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 E \u2264 4\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 3 10\n7 7 7\n4 6 10\n7 10 9\n9 9\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second score among all the enrollees - the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter the university.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Today, Noodle announced one of his most extra-ordinary ideas ever - Project Spoon. \n Noodle plans to deploy large spoons in the atmosphere so that people all around the world can download food directly from his kitchen thereby saving him a lot of overhead cost. Yes, you read that right. Large spoons suspended in the atmosphere. \n Noodle decides the following strategy to implement his idea. He will deploy exactly N spoons in the country. Every spoon can cater to as many cities as it wants. The only catch is that between every pair of  spoons A and B,  A must cater to at-least one city that B doesn't cater to, and  B  must cater to at-least one city that A doesn't cater to. \n Noodle would like to know what is the minimum number of cities a country must have for his strategy to be successful. Since, he is not all that good with calculation, he asks you to help him with it. \n\nInput\n The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Click here to read it. \nThe following problem appeared in the CodeChef March '09 Challenge\nIn the mysterious country of Byteland, everything is quite different from what you'd \n\nnormally expect. In most places, if you were approached by two mobsters in a dark alley, they would \n\nprobably tell you to give them all the money that you have. If you refused, or didn't have any - \n\nthey might even beat you up.\n\nIn Byteland the government decided that even the slightest chance of someone getting injured has to be ruled out. So, they introduced a strict policy. When a mobster approaches you in a dark \n\nalley, he asks you for a specific amount of money. You are obliged to show him all the money that \n\nyou have, but you only need to pay up if he can find a subset of your banknotes whose total value \n\nmatches his demand. Since banknotes in Byteland can have any positive integer value smaller than \n\none thousand you are quite likely to get off without paying.\n\nBoth the citizens and the gangsters of Byteland have very positive feelings about the system. No one ever \n\ngets hurt, the gangsters don't lose their jobs, and there are quite a few rules that minimize that \nprobability of getting mugged (the first one is: don't go into dark alleys - and this one is said to work in other places also).\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t, the number of test cases (about 100). Then t test cases follow. Each test case starts with n, the \n\nnumber of banknotes in your wallet, and m, the amount of money the muggers asked of you. Then n \n\nnumbers follow, representing values of your banknotes. Your wallet does not hold more than 20 banknotes, and the value of a single banknote is never more than 1000.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line with the word 'Yes' if there is a subset of your banknotes that sums  to m, and 'No' otherwise.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\n3 3\n1\n1\n1\n5 11\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n5 23\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n5 13\n1\n5\n5\n10\n10\n20 132\n17\n6\n4\n998\n254\n137\n259\n153\n154\n3\n28\n19\n123\n542\n857\n23\n687\n35\n99\n999\n\nOutput:\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation: For example, in the last case you have to pay up, since: 6+3+123=132.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He currently has n stems of bamboo, Hi - height of i-th stem of bamboo (0-based numeration). \n\nToday inspector Andrii from World Bamboo Association is visiting the plantation. He doesn't like current situation. He wants the height of i-th stem to be Di, for each i from 0 to n-1, inclusive.\n\nLittle Elephant is going to buy some special substance. One bottle of such substance he can use to single stem of bamboo. After using substance for stem i, the height of i-th stem is decrased by 1 and the height of j-th stem is increased by 1 for each j not equal to i. Note that it is possible for some of the stems to have negative height, but after all transformations all stems should have positive height.\n\nSubstance is very expensive. Help Little Elephant and find the minimal number of bottles of substance required for changing current plantation to one that inspector wants. If it's impossible, print -1.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contain single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains single integer n - the number of stems in the plantation. Second line contains n integers separated by single space - starting plantation. Next line of each test case contains n integers - plantation that inspector Andrii requires.\n\n\nOutput\nIn T lines print T integers - the answers for the corresponding test cases.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 50\n\n1 <= n <= 50\n\n1 <= Hi, Di <= 50\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n3\n3 2 2\n4 5 3\n\n\nOutput:\n-1\n1\n5\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
