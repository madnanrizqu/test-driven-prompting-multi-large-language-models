# Task 174 Analysis: Triangle Validity Checker

## Problem
Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid when given three angles. A triangle is valid if the sum equals 180 degrees.

## Key Difference Between Solutions

### Failed Solution (normal_fail.json)
```python
if sum(angles) == 180:
```
- Only checks if angles sum to 180°
- **Missing constraint**: Doesn't validate that all angles are positive

### Passed Solution (td_passed.json)
```python
if sum(angles) == 180 and all(angle > 0 for angle in angles):
```
- Checks sum equals 180° **AND** all angles are positive
- **Additional constraint**: `all(angle > 0 for angle in angles)`

## Critical Insight

The test case `180 0 0` reveals the issue:
- Sum = 180°  (satisfies basic requirement)
- Contains 0° angle  (geometrically invalid triangle)

Expected output: `NO` (triangle is invalid)

## Impact of Test-Driven Development

The TD approach discovered an **implicit mathematical requirement** not explicitly stated in the problem:

1. **Explicit requirement**: Sum of angles = 180°
2. **Implicit requirement**: All angles must be > 0° (discovered through testing)

This demonstrates how test-driven development can reveal hidden constraints that specification-only approaches might miss, leading to more robust solutions that handle edge cases correctly.

## Conclusion

The failed solution was mathematically incomplete, while the TD solution correctly identified that triangle validity requires both angle sum and positivity constraints.
