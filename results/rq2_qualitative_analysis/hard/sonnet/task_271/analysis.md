# Task 271 Analysis: Normal vs Test-Driven Approach

## Problem Overview
**Asmany Numbers**: Numbers representing the count of binary strings of length L that have equal numbers of "00" and "11" substrings.

## Key Differences

### Normal Prompt Solution (FAILED)
- **Fundamental Misunderstanding**: Assumed Asmany numbers follow powers of 2 pattern
- **Incorrect Sequence**: `{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}`
- **Logic Error**: Missing validation for positive numbers
- **Root Cause**: No concrete examples to guide understanding of the mathematical sequence

### Test-Driven Prompt Solution (PASSED)
- **Correct Understanding**: Derived actual Asmany number sequence from test cases
- **Accurate Sequence**: `{2, 4, 6, 12, 20, 40, 70, 140, 252, 484, 924, 1820}`
- **Proper Validation**: Added `N > 0` check for positive number validation
- **Guided Learning**: Test cases revealed the true mathematical pattern

## Critical Insight
The test-driven approach prevented a **fundamental conceptual error**. Without concrete input/output examples, the LLM made an incorrect assumption about the mathematical pattern. The test cases acted as **specification by example**, revealing that Asmany numbers don't follow simple geometric progressions but have a more complex combinatorial structure.

## Impact
- **Normal**: Failed due to wrong mathematical model
- **Test-Driven**: Succeeded by learning the correct pattern from examples
- **Lesson**: Complex mathematical problems benefit significantly from concrete test cases that reveal underlying patterns
