# Task 283: Euler's Totient Function Analysis

## Problem Description
Find the value i (2 d i d N) that maximizes Æ(i)/i, where Æ is Euler's totient function.

## Solution Comparison: Normal vs Test-Driven Approach

### Normal Prompt Solution (Failed)
**Attempts**: 5
**Status**: Failed all test cases

**Algorithm Approach**:
- Uses flawed mathematical reasoning
- Only checks numbers of the form 2^k * 3^m with nested loops (k,m up to 65)
- Misses the key insight that Æ(i)/i is typically maximized by prime numbers

**Code Issues**:
```python
# Incorrect approach - only checks specific composite forms
for k in range(1, 65):
    for m in range(1, 65):
        i = (2 ** k) * (3 ** m)
        if i > N:
            break
        phi_i = i * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)  # Only for 2^k * 3^m
```

**Mathematical Misunderstanding**:
The solution assumes maximum Æ(i)/i occurs at specific composite numbers, but the correct answer is usually the largest prime d N since Æ(p)/p = (p-1)/p is maximized by larger primes.

### Test-Driven Prompt Solution (Passed)
**Attempts**: 3
**Status**: Passed all test cases

**Algorithm Approach**:
- Uses correct brute-force approach with proper prime factorization
- Iterates through all numbers from 3 to N+1
- Correctly calculates Æ(i) for each number using trial division

**Code Implementation**:
```python
# Correct approach - checks all numbers with proper Æ calculation
for i in range(3, N + 1):
    phi = i
    n = i
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if n % p == 0:
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
            phi -= phi // p  # Apply Æ formula: Æ(n) = n * (1 - 1/p)
        p += 1
    if n > 1:
        phi -= phi // n
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Mathematical Understanding
- **Normal**: Incorrectly assumes optimal values come from specific composite forms
- **TD**: Understands that primes typically maximize Æ(i)/i ratio

### 2. Test Case Guidance
- **Normal**: Only had problem description and function signature
- **TD**: Extensive test cases revealed the pattern (answers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23... mostly primes)

### 3. Implementation Strategy
- **Normal**: Complex but fundamentally flawed nested loop structure
- **TD**: Simple, correct iteration with proper totient function calculation

### 4. Pattern Recognition
The test cases in the TD prompt clearly showed:
- For N=2: answer is 2 (prime)
- For N=3: answer is 3 (prime)
- For N=6: answer is 5 (largest prime d 6)
- For N=14: answer is 13 (largest prime d 14)

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why Normal Failed**: The solution misunderstood the mathematical problem, focusing on a narrow subset of numbers (powers of 2 and 3) rather than understanding that prime numbers generally maximize the Æ(i)/i ratio.

**Why TD Succeeded**: The comprehensive test cases provided crucial pattern recognition, showing that answers are typically the largest prime d N. This guided the LLM toward implementing a general solution that correctly computes Æ(i) for all candidates.

## Conclusion

This case demonstrates the power of test-driven development in mathematical problem-solving. The test cases didn't just verify correctnessthey revealed the underlying mathematical pattern that the normal prompt failed to convey, leading to a fundamentally different and correct algorithmic approach.
